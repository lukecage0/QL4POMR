31815570,"Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is defined as elevated cardiac biomarkers of necrosis in the absence of persistent ST-segment elevation in the setting of anginal symptoms or other acute event. It carries a poorer prognosis than most ST-segment elevation events, owing to the typical comorbidity burden of the older NSTEMI patients as well as diverse etiologies that add complexity to therapeutic decision-making. It may result from an acute atherothrombotic event ('Type 1') or as the result of other causes of mismatch of myocardial oxygen supply and demand ('Type 2'). Regardless of type and other clinical factors, the hospital medicine specialist is increasingly responsible for managing or coordinating the care of these patients. Following published guidelines for risk stratification and basing anti-anginal, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, other pharmacologic therapies, and overall management approach on that individualized patient risk assessment can be expected to result in better short- and long-term clinical outcomes, including near-term readmission and recurrent events. We present here a review of the evidence basis and expert commentary to assist the hospitalist in achieving those improved outcomes in NSTEMI. Given that the Society for Hospital Medicine cites care of patients with acute coronary syndrome as a core competency for hospitalists, it is essential that those specialists stay current on optimal NSTEMI care.Abbreviations: ACC: American college of cardiology; ACCOAST: comparison of prasugrel at the time of diagnosis in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction; ACS: acute coronary syndrome; ADP: adenosine diphosphate; AHA: American heart association; ARB: angiotensin II receptor blocker; ASA: acetylsalicylic acid; CABG: coronary artery bypass graft: CAD: coronary artery disease; CCTA: coronary computed tomography angiography; cTn: cardiac troponin; CRUSADE: can rapid risk stratification of unstable angina patients suppress adverse outcomes with early implementation of the ACC / AHA guidelines; CURE: clopidogrel in unstable angina to prevent recurrent events; CURRENT: OASIS-7 clopidogrel and aspirin optimal dose usage to reduce recurrent events-seventh organization to assess strategies in ischemic syndromes; ECG: electrocardiogram; ED: emergency department; ESRD: endstage renal disease; ESC: European society of cardiology; FDA: food and drug administration; GRACE: global registry of acute coronary events; LVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction; MACE: major adverse cardiac event; MI: myocardial infarction; MVO2: myocardial oxygen demand; NSTEMI: non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction; NTG: Nitroglycerin; PCI: percutaneous coronary intervention; platyp"
32491818,"A coronary artery is a well-developed trilaminar structure. The innermost layer is termed the tunica intima, which is lined with endothelial cells that make contact with the circulating arterial blood. The endothelial cells have a tightly regulated vascular homeostasis mechanism, failure of which leads to atherosclerotic disease process. Multivessel disease is defined as significant stenosis (> 70%) in two or more major coronary arteries of 2.5 mm diameter or more. About 40% to 50% of patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have multivessel coronary disease."
37288564,Aims: An observational nationwide all-comers prospective register study to analyse outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in unprotected left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease. (1) To describe the incidence of LMCA disease in patients undergoing CABG or PCI. (2) To compare the outcomes of patients with LMCA disease undergoing CABG or PCI. (3) To compare the outcomes of patients with LMCA disease undergoing CABG or PCI.
37352324,"Background: Despite the advances in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, effective treatment remains to be established to improve the quality of life and prognosis of patients with chronic coronary syndromes. This study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy, which we have developed as a novel non-invasive angiogenic therapy through upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). (1) Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind, and multicenter study."
35360934,"In the evaluation and management of patients with stable chest pain / chronic coronary syndrome, cardiologists need to be able to weigh up the relative merits of managing these patients using either optimal therapy alone or optimal therapy plus revascularization. These decisions rely on an understanding of both the presence and the degree of coronary atheroma and myocardial ischemia, and the impact that these have on patients' symptoms and their prognosis. In this review the authors examine the relative impact of the anatomical and physiological assessment of patients with chronic coronary syndrome and how it can be used to achieve optimal and tailored therapy."
32246444,"Coronary revascularization is the most important strategy for coronary artery disease. This review summarizes the current most prevalent approaches for coronary revascularization and discusses the evidence on the mechanisms, indications, techniques, and outcomes of these approaches. Targeting coronary thrombus, fibrinolysis is indicated for patients with diagnosed myocardial infarction and without high risk of severe hemorrhage. The development of fibrinolytic agents has improved the outcomes of ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Percutaneous coronary intervention has become the most frequently performed procedure for coronary artery disease. The evolution of stents plays an important role in the result of the procedure. Coronary artery bypass grafting is the most effective revascularization approach for stenotic coronary arteries. The choice of conduits and surgical techniques are important determinants of patient outcomes. Multidisciplinary decision-making should analyze current evidence, considering the clinical condition of patients, and determine the safety and necessity for coronary revascularization with either PCI or CABG. For coronary artery disease with more complex lesions like left main disease and multivessel disease, CABG results in more complete revascularization than PCI. Furthermore, comorbidities, such as heart failure and diabetes, are always correlated with adverse clinical events, and a routine invasive strategy should be recommended. For patients under revascularization, secondary prevention therapies are also of important value for the prevention of subsequent adverse events."
37487850,"The current guidelines for the management and treatment of acute coronary syndromes do not fully consider the role of age in guiding medical or invasive management. We investigated the characteristics, management strategies, and clinical outcomes of patients aged 80 years and older presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). A cohort study using the nationwide inpatient sample database of patients aged 80 years and older presenting with NSTEMI in the United States between 2012 to 2018 was performed. About 24.2% (151,472 / 625,916) of NSTEMI patients were 80 years and older. Older patients (≥ 80 years) had higher in-hospital mortality and cardiovascular complications compared to younger patients (odds ratio (OR) 1.79, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.71-1.88, P < 0.001). Among older patients, conservative medical management was associated with higher inpatient mortality compared to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (OR 2.3, 95% CI 2.18-2.41, P < 0.001) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.76-2.09, P < 0.001). The highest mortality rate was observed in older patients who underwent both PCI and CABG, followed by those treated conservatively and those undergoing coronary angiography without revascularization. This study provides valuable insights into the clinical characteristics and outcomes of elderly patients presenting with NSTEMI in the United States. The results emphasize the importance of a tailored approach to the management of ACS in elderly patients and the need for improved revascularization strategies to reduce in-hospital mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, the clinician should tailor the management of older patients presenting with NSTEMI."
35048207,"Literature regarding recent trends, mortality outcomes of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in cardiac amyloidosis (CA) patients is limited.To study coronary interventions, and trends in prevalence and mortality outcomes among CA patients with STEMI.Data from the national readmissions database (NRD) sample that constitutes 49.1% of the stratified sample of all hospitals in the USA, representing more than 95% of the national population, were analyzed for hospitalizations associated with CA with STEMI. A linear p-trend was used to assess the trends.Out of the total 4252 adult patients (mean age 73.3 ± 11.7 years, 40.2% females) with diagnosis of CA, 439 (10.3%) had STEMI while 3813 (89.7%) had no STEMI. STEMI-CA patients had higher rates of multi-organ manifestations including VT / VF (12% vs 8.5%; p-value < 0.001), cardiogenic shock (12.7% vs 7.3%; p < 0.001), AKI requiring dialysis (5.3% vs 4%; p < 0.001), and ICU admissions (25.2% vs 15.3%; p < 0.001) compared to CA without STEMI. CA-STEMI had increased mortality rates (23.7% vs 16.1%, p < 0.001) compared to CA without STEMI. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, coronary interventions including PCI (OR 0.6, CI 0.4-1.1; p = 0.3) and CABG (OR 0.7, CI 0.3-1.8; p = 0.2) had no association with mortality among CA patients. The absolute yearly trends for prevalence and mortality associated with STEMI in CA patients remained steady over the study years (linear p-trends 0.2 and 0.6, respectively).CA-STEMI is associated with significant complications and mortality. Coronary interventions may not have significant mortality benefits. Thus, more research will be needed to improve mortality rates among these patients."
34671860,Purpose of review: We assessed the differences in the 2020 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) versus 2015 ESC and 2014 American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines on the management of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). (1) We also assessed the differences in the recommendations for the management of NSTE-ACS in the ESC versus 2015 ESC and 2014 ACC guidelines. (2) We also assessed the differences in the recommendations for the management of NSTE-ACS in the ESC versus 2015 ESC and 2014 ACC guidelines.

32140370,"Background Management of elderly patients with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) continues to be a source of controversy due to underrepresentation in large-scale clinical trials and the increased risk of adverse outcomes after both invasive (Percutaneous coronary intervention and Coronary artery bypass grafting) and non-invasive therapies. Recent randomized clinical trials have shown improved short term and intermediate term outcomes among high risk NSTEMI patients receiving early invasive management versus conservative medical management. However, how this is reflected in U.S. clinical practice for elderly patients has not been reported. Objective To identify the trend of invasive management in patients with NSTEMI, particularly among elderly population. Methods We used data from National Hospital Discharge Survey to identify all adult patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for NSTEMI from the years 2005 to 2009. The goal was to investigate the trends in time of invasive therapy for patients diagnosed with NSTEMI. We then stratified the patients according to age > 65 and ≤ 65, and compared the temporal trends between two age groups. Results Among 21,306 patients diagnosed with NSTEMI between 2005 and 2009, the median age was 73 years (IQR: 61-82 years), 54% were males and 57% were White. The proportions of patients age > 65 years receiving invasive management (21%, N = 13978) was significantly lower than those age ≤ 65 (41%, N = 7328) (p < 0.001). Moreover, in both age groups, the proportion of patients receiving early invasive management decreased substantially over time (p < 0.001). Conclusion Despite numerous studies promoting the use of early invasive management for NSTEMI patients, the proportion of patients receiving invasive intervention gradually decreased from 2005-2009, more so in elderly population. The decrease seen in overall proportion of patients receiving invasive therapy could be associated with older median age of NSTEMI patients; 73 years (IQR: 61-82). Our future analyses will investigate if this trend maintains after adjusting for other factors (sex, co-morbid conditions, insurance status, year of procedure, hospital region, and hospital bed-size) thought to be associated with the management of NSTEMI in elderly patients."
37040853,"We aimed to evaluate longitudinal trends of racial and ethnic disparities in the utilization of diagnostic angiograms, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We retrospectively analyzed the National Inpatient Sample (2005-2019). The 15-year period was divided into 5, 3-year periods. Our study included 9 million adult patients (NSTEMI, 72%; STEMI, 28%). No improvement in utilization of these procedures was seen in period 5 (2017-2019) vs period 1 (2005-2007) for both NSTEMI and STEMI in non-White patients vs White patients (P > 0.05 for all comparisons), excepting in CABG for STEMI in Black patients vs White patients (difference in CABG rate: period 1, 2.6%; period 5, 1.4%; P = 0.03). Reducing disparities in PCI for NSTEMI and both PCI and CABG for STEMI in Black patients vs White patients was associated with improved outcomes."
34902394,"Background: Coronary artery bypass (CABG) is an important revascularization procedure with excellent long-term results. However, bypass grafts, particularly venous grafts, develop structural changes and atherosclerotic plaques that may cause angina or even acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Here we aimed to study patients with previous CABG presenting with an ACS and evaluated their cardiovascular (CV) risk profile, clinical presentations, angiographic findings, management strategies and short and long term outcomes. (1) Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent CABG between January 2010 and December 2015."
35286661,Purpose of review: To review the evidence supporting the use of transradial access (TRA) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). (1) To describe the current evidence supporting the use of TRA for PCI in ACS. (2) To discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of TRA compared to transfemoral access (TFA). (3) To review the current evidence supporting the use of TRA for PCI in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). (4) To discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of TRA compared to TFA for PCI in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
30823956,"Among the sick patients suffering from non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS), the accuracy of fractional flow reserve (FFR) -directed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is still ambiguous. Studies were obtained from PubMed, Embase, Wanfang Data, and Cochrane Library electronic statistics from their initiation up to April 2018, to explore the differences between the FFR-directed approach and the coronary angiography (CA) / stress perfusion scintigraphy (SPS) -directed approach in the outcomes of NSTACS patients. Odds ratio was determined for individual studies, quality assessments, heterogeneity, and publishing bias analyses. In total, there were 5 studies involving 1,366 patients (606 FFR patients and 760 CA patients). Compared with CA, the collection of the studies indicated that FFR had a lower incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) (OR, 0.61; 95% CI: 0.39-0.96; p < 0.05). However, none showed important disparities in main adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, OR, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.53-1.03; p = 0.07), all-cause death rate (OR, 0.83; 95% CI: 0.45-1.54; p = 0.56), and major bleeding (OR, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.25-4.03; p = 1). The FFR-directed management of patients with NSTEACS had a close relationship with the serious decrease in incidence of MI without statistical significance. Future large-scale research, which is carried out at random and with a control, is needed to confirm these conclusions."
32408860,"Background: Timely restoration of bloodflow acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) reduces myocardial damage and improves prognosis. The objective of this study was describe the association of demographic factors with hospitalisation rates for STEMI and time to angiography, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) in New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia. (1). (2) Methods: Data from the New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Myocardial Infarction Registry (NSTMR) were used to identify patients with STEMI admitted to hospitals in NSW and ACT between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014."
35810843,"Outcomes of patients presenting with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) with multivessel coronary disease (MVD) and / or unprotected left main coronary artery disease (CAD) revascularized with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is not well defined. MEDLINE / PubMed and EMBASE / Ovid were queried for studies that investigated PCI vs CABG in this disease subset. The primary outcome was major cardiac adverse events (MACE) at 30 days and long-term follow-up (3-5 years). The final analysis included 9 studies with a total of 9299 patients. No significant difference was observed between PCI and CABG in 30 days MACE (risk ratio [RR] 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-2.39, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke. A meta-regression analysis revealed patients with a history of PCI had higher risk of MACE with PCI as compared with CABG. At long-term follow-up, PCI compared with CABG was associated with higher risk of MACE (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.28-1.81), myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization, while no difference was observed in the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. In patients with NSTE-ACS and MVD or unprotected left main CAD, no differences were observed in the clinical outcomes between PCI and CABG at 30 days follow-up. With long-term follow-up, PCI was associated with a higher risk of MACE."

32871111,"The objectives of this study were to investigate the outcome differences between ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients treated with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort follow-up study of consecutive patients with STEMI (surgery ≤ 48 hours of admission; n = 348) or NSTEMI (n = 1,160) revascularized with first-time isolated CABG in Finland using nationwide registries (median age 68 years, 24% women). The short- and long-term (10-year) outcomes were studied with inverse propensity probability weight adjustment for baseline features. The median follow-up was 5.2 years. In-hospital mortality (11.4% vs 5.3%; adj. odds ratio [OR] 2.27; confidence interval [CI] 1.41 to 3.66; p = 0.001) and re-sternotomy rates (6.9% vs 3.5%; adj. OR 2.07; CI 1.22 to 3.51; p = 0.007) were higher in STEMI patients. Long-term all-cause mortality did not differ between STEMI and NSTEMI patients among all operated patients (30.2% vs 28.3%; adj. HR 1.30; CI 0.97 to 1.75; p = 0.080) or hospital survivors (21.6 vs 24.3%; HR 0.93; CI 0.64 to 1.36; p = 0.713). Occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular event in hospital survivors within 10 years was 34.7% in STEMI versus 29.6% in NSTEMI (adj. HR 1.24; CI 0.88 to 1.76; p = 0.220). Occurrences of cardiovascular death (14.6% vs 14.4%; p = 0.773), myocardial infarction (MI; 15.2% vs 10.3%; p = 0.203), and stroke (10.8% vs 14.8%; p = 0.242) were also comparable. In conclusion, patients with STEMI have poorer short-term outcome compared to NSTEMI patients after revascularization by CABG, but the long-term outcomes are comparable regardless of MI type. Thus, both short- and long-term risks should be considered when evaluating patient s for CABG eligibility by MI type."
31598429,"Current pretreatment guidelines for coronary angiography in unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) involve the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT: aspirin + adenosine diphosphate (ADP) P2Y12 inhibitor), whereas the use of triple antiplatelet therapy (TAPT: aspirin + ADP P2Y12 inhibitor + GpIIb / IIIa inhibitor) has limited data due to the increased bleeding risk. However, a study directly comparing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of DAPT vs. TAPT has not been done. A decision analysis was constructed to determine the ideal pretreatment antiplatelet regimen for UA / NSTEMI patients. The parameters were calculated based on published randomized clinical trials. They consisted of probabilities based on a pretreatment strategy (DAPT, TAPT), interventions (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), medical management), and 30-day outcomes (no event, bleeding, vascular event, death). A 10,000 run Monte Carlo simulation provided two outputs: estimated life-years extended and costs for each treatment modality. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were taken into consideration using calculated coefficients from the literature. The cost / QALY ratio was $1,923 / QALY for DAPT vs. $4,734 / QALY for TAPT. The use of DAPT for pretreatment was favored (2.46 more cost-effective than TAPT). These results will aid clinicians in providing the most clinically sound and fiscally responsible care for UA / NSTEMI patients."
