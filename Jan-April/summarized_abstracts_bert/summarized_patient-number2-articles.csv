31815570,"Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is defined as elevated cardiac biomarkers of necrosis in the absence of persistent ST-segment elevation in the setting of anginal symptoms or other acute event. Following published guidelines for risk stratification and basing anti-anginal, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, other pharmacologic therapies, and overall management approach on that individualized patient risk assessment can be expected to result in better short- and long-term clinical outcomes, including near-term readmission and recurrent events."
32491818,"The innermost layer is termed the tunica intima, which is lined with endothelial cells that make contact with the circulating arterial blood. About 40% to 50% of patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have multivessel coronary disease."
37288564,Aims: An observational nationwide all-comers prospective register study to analyse outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in unprotected left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease.
37352324,"Background: Despite the advances in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, effective treatment remains to be established to improve the quality of life and prognosis of patients with chronic coronary syndromes. This study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy, which we have developed as a novel non-invasive angiogenic therapy through upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)."
35360934,"In the evaluation and management of patients with stable chest pain/chronic coronary syndrome, cardiologists need to be able to weigh up the relative merits of managing these patients using either optimal therapy alone or optimal therapy plus revascularization. These decisions rely on an understanding of both the presence and the degree of coronary atheroma and myocardial ischemia, and the impact that these have on patients' symptoms and their prognosis."
32246444,"This review summarizes the current most prevalent approaches for coronary revascularization and discusses the evidence on the mechanisms, indications, techniques, and outcomes of these approaches. Multidisciplinary decision-making should analyze current evidence, considering the clinical condition of patients, and determine the safety and necessity for coronary revascularization with either PCI or CABG."
37487850,"The current guidelines for the management and treatment of acute coronary syndromes do not fully consider the role of age in guiding medical or invasive management. We investigated the characteristics, management strategies, and clinical outcomes of patients aged 80 years and older presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)."
35048207,"Literature regarding recent trends, mortality outcomes of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in cardiac amyloidosis (CA) patients is limited. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, coronary interventions including PCI (OR 0.6, CI 0.4-1.1; p = 0.3) and CABG (OR 0.7, CI 0.3-1.8; p = 0.2) had no association with mortality among CA patients."
34671860,Purpose of review: We assessed the differences in the 2020 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) versus 2015 ESC and 2014 American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines on the management of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS).
32140370,"Background Management of elderly patients with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) continues to be a source of controversy due to underrepresentation in large-scale clinical trials and the increased risk of adverse outcomes after both invasive (Percutaneous coronary intervention and Coronary artery bypass grafting) and non-invasive therapies. Conclusion Despite numerous studies promoting the use of early invasive management for NSTEMI patients, the proportion of patients receiving invasive intervention gradually decreased from 2005-2009, more so in elderly population."
37040853,"We aimed to evaluate longitudinal trends of racial and ethnic disparities in the utilization of diagnostic angiograms, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). No improvement in utilization of these procedures was seen in period 5 (2017-2019) vs period 1 (2005-2007) for both NSTEMI and STEMI in non-White patients vs White patients (P > 0.05 for all comparisons), excepting in CABG for STEMI in Black patients vs White patients (difference in CABG rate: period 1, 2.6%; period 5, 1.4%; P = 0.03)."
34902394,"However, bypass grafts, particularly venous grafts, develop structural changes and atherosclerotic plaques that may cause angina or even acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Here we aimed to study patients with previous CABG presenting with an ACS and evaluated their cardiovascular (CV) risk profile, clinical presentations, angiographic findings, management strategies and short and long term outcomes."
35286661,Purpose of review: To review the evidence supporting the use of transradial access (TRA) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
30823956,"Among the sick patients suffering from non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS), the accuracy of fractional flow reserve (FFR)-directed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is still ambiguous. Compared with CA, the collection of the studies indicated that FFR had a lower incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) (OR, 0.61; 95% CI: 0.39-0.96; p <0.05)."
32408860,"Background: Timely restoration of bloodflow acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) reduces myocardial damage and improves prognosis. The objective of this study was describe the association of demographic factors with hospitalisation rates for STEMI and time to angiography, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) in New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia."
35810843,"Outcomes of patients presenting with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) with multivessel coronary disease (MVD) and/or unprotected left main coronary artery disease (CAD) revascularized with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is not well defined. At long-term follow-up, PCI compared with CABG was associated with higher risk of MACE (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.28-1.81), myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization, while no difference was observed in the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality."
33931231,Objectives: The study objectives were to describe the trends and outcomes of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting after ST-elevation myocardial infarction using a nationwide database.
36004105,Objective: To compare the mortality associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).
32871111,The objectives of this study were to investigate the outcome differences between ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients treated with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). Occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular event in hospital survivors within 10 years was 34.7% in STEMI versus 29.6% in NSTEMI (adj.
31598429,"Current pretreatment guidelines for coronary angiography in unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) involve the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT: aspirin + adenosine diphosphate (ADP) P2Y12 inhibitor), whereas the use of triple antiplatelet therapy (TAPT: aspirin + ADP P2Y12 inhibitor + GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor) has limited data due to the increased bleeding risk. They consisted of probabilities based on a pretreatment strategy (DAPT, TAPT), interventions (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), medical management), and 30-day outcomes (no event, bleeding, vascular event, death)."
