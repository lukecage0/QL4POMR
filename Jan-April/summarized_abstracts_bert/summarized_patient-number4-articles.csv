32358144,"The causes of neonatal VFP are varied and include central nervous system disorders, birth-related trauma, mediastinal masses, iatrogenic injuries, and idiopathic cases. A clinical assessment of swallowing function is necessary in all cases of VFP, with some patients also requiring an instrumental swallow assessment."
29939533,Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a term used to describe pneumonia (lung infection) that develops in a patient who has been on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. It accounts for 7% to 32% of healthcare-associated infections and 10% of all pediatric device-related infections reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
29261912,"Progression to cardiopulmonary arrest and ultimately death is likely in the absence of effective and timely airway management. Therefore, one of the primary goals of airway management is to provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation to avoid or halt the progression to cardiopulmonary arrest."
34215399,"Special considerations regarding obesity, chronic and acute illness, underlying developmental abnormalities, and age can all affect preparation and intervention toward securing a definitive airway. Mechanical ventilation strategies should focus on limiting peak inspiratory pressures and optimizing lung protective tidal volumes."
36806432,"Background: Airway foreign body can be a life-threatening issue in pediatric and adult patients, and the majority of these patients will first present to the emergency department."
35001832,"The unique challenges of pediatric respiratory and airway emergencies require the development and maintenance of a prehospital quality management program that includes pediatric-focused medical oversight and clinical care expertise, data collection, operational considerations, focused education, and clinician competency evaluation. EMS agencies should define quality indicators for pediatric-specific elements in respiratory distress and airway management and benchmark performance based on regional and national standards."
34336618,"Although the majority of patients show mild symptoms, the disease can rapidly progress in severe cases and develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that may lead to therapeutic interventions, including oxygenation, tracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Hence, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures, such as endotracheal intubation, may put the healthcare workers at a high risk of infection."
32580323,"There have been significant advancements in the safe delivery of anesthesia as well as improvements in surgical technique; however, the perioperative period can still be high risk for the pediatric patient. There are only a few risk prediction models/scoring tools developed for and validated in the pediatric patient population, but they have been useful in helping identify the key factors associated with a high likelihood of developing PRCs."

35001823,"Devices and techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, supraglottic airway devices, and noninvasive ventilation offer important tools for airway management in critically ill EMS patients. Advanced approaches to pediatric ETI including drug-assisted airway management, apneic oxygenation, and use of direct and video laryngoscopy require further research to more clearly define their risks and benefits prior to widespread implementation."
34527357,"Central airway obstruction (CAO), which results from malignant, benign or iatrogenic etiologies, causes significant morbidity and mortality and can be seen in both the pediatric and adult patient population. In severe CAO where there is concern for total loss of the airway creating a life-threatening situation for the patient during procedural intervention, short term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO has been successfully reported in the literature to provide ventilation and oxygenation support throughout the procedure."
34458951,"Antiviral and immunomodulatory medications are spared for hospitalized children with respiratory distress or severe to critical disease. Up till now, remdesivir is the only USFDA-approved anti-COVID-19 medication indicated in the majority of symptomatic patients with moderate to severe disease."
35001818,"Although pediatric airway and respiratory emergencies represent high-acuity situations, the ability of EMS clinicians to effectively manage these patients is hampered by infrequent clinical exposure and shortcomings in pediatric-specific education. Initial and continuing pediatric-focused education should be structured to maintain EMS clinician competency in the assessment and management of pediatric airway and respiratory emergencies and should be provided on a recurring basis to mitigate the decay of EMS clinicians' knowledge and skills that occurs due to infrequent field-based clinical exposure."
36973036,"We aimed to evaluate the success rate of NRS in pediatric high-dependency units (PHDUs), identify predictors of NRS failure, quantify adverse events, and assess outcomes."
34900629,
31164485,"Background: Chest physiotherapy has been reported to be beneficial in specific clinical contexts, yet it carries a risk of potential serious adverse events with little benefit in other patients. This study aims to validate the Airway Clearance and Expansion Index (ACE-I) for the serial assessment of hospitalized pediatric patients with impaired airway clearance and to establish reliability in score acquisition across a range of pediatric respiratory disease states."
31088891,"Rapid response teams have become necessary components of patient care within the hospital community, including for airway management. This predictability has led to the creation of airway consultation services designed to develop airway management plans for patients experiencing respiratory distress and who are at risk for having a difficult airway requiring advanced airway management."
