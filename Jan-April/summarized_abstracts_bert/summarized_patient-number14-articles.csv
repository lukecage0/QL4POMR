34449851,"Importance: Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare form of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction that affects women late in pregnancy and the postpartum period. A diagnosis of exclusion, peripartum cardiomyopathy can be difficult to diagnose in the context of the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy and requires a high index of suspicion."
32856715,"Importance: Endometriosis is a major health concern in the adolescent population and significantly impacts daily physical and psychosocial functioning. Endometriosis can have differing presentations in this population, and the diagnosis often involves long delays and multiple visits to specialists."
