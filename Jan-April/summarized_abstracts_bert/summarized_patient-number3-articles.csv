34865718,"Infections have a significant impact on increasing both the morbidity and mortality rate of patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Diabetic patients are prone to postoperative infection after CABG, however, prophylactic antibiotics should not be the only strategy used to reduce the risk of postoperative infection in diabetic patients."
