related sclerosing cholangitis ( igg4 - sc ) is a type of autoimmune pancreatitis associated with elevated serum igg4 levels. none, nonetypes 3 and 4 igg4 - sc are difficult to differentiate from bile duct cancer, and hepatectomy has been reported sporadically in such situations. none, none, describe a rare case of a patient with igg4 - sc but without pancreatic lesions. accurate diagnosis was made, without the need for performing a partial hepatectomy. the patient was a 69 - year - old man referred for the evaluation of jaundice and steatorrhea persisting for 1 week. he had a prior history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hypertrophy, with no previous pancreatic disease or autoimmune diseases. physical examination revealed normal vital signs, mild icterus, and jaundice, with no abnormalities on abdominal examination. laboratory studies showed elevated total bilirubin, liver, and biliary enzyme levels. endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed for the evaluation and treatment of obstructive jaundice. despite further evaluation, the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma could not be ruled out. therefore, the patient was transferred to the department of surgery of jichi medical university hospital for further evaluation and management. further laboratory studies showed that the white blood cell count was 7300 / mul, and the hemoglobin level was 10. 3 g / dl, which is consistent with anemia. the platelet count was 102 * 103 / mul, indicating thrombocytopenia. serum chemistries showed total bilirubin level of 8. 01 mg / dl, serum aspartate aminotransferase level of 839 u / l, and serum alanine aminotransferase level of 500 u / l. the serum level of glutamyl transpeptidase was elevated to 230 u / l. serum amylase was not elevated ( 85 u / l ). serum igg and ige levels were increased to 1744 mg / dl and 536 mg / dl, respectively, and serum igg4 level was increased to 381 mg / dl. tests conducted for the presence of antinuclear antibody were positive. those conducted for the presence of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was 2. 2 ng / ml and serum ca 19 - 9 level was elevated to 42 u / ml. serologic examinations for infectious diseases were negative for both hepatitis b surface antibody and hepatitis c virus antibody. a multidetector computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed thickening of the bile duct wall associated with the enhancement of the right hepatic duct, extending from the proximal confluence of the common hepatic duct to the left and right hepatic ducts. in addition, dilatation of the peripheral intrahepatic bile ducts was present. the right portal vein.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install rouge-score","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-10T19:54:38.565754Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-10T19:54:38.566386Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-10T19:54:52.494453Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-10T19:54:38.566345Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-10T19:54:52.493403Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Collecting rouge-score\n  Downloading rouge_score-0.1.2.tar.gz (17 kB)\n  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25ldone\n\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: absl-py in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from rouge-score) (1.4.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: nltk in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from rouge-score) (3.2.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from rouge-score) (1.23.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.14.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from rouge-score) (1.16.0)\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: rouge-score\n  Building wheel for rouge-score (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25ldone\n\u001b[?25h  Created wheel for rouge-score: filename=rouge_score-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl size=24954 sha256=61b459a066c044831f1baeea65850c9f0bd7fc4a7b0b6128079f5b99224fa3f4\n  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/5f/dd/89/461065a73be61a532ff8599a28e9beef17985c9e9c31e541b4\nSuccessfully built rouge-score\nInstalling collected packages: rouge-score\nSuccessfully installed rouge-score-0.1.2\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from rouge_score import rouge_scorer\n\ndef compute_rouge(reference, candidate):\n    scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum'], use_stemmer=True)\n    scores = scorer.score(reference, candidate)\n    return scores\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    file_path = \"/kaggle/input/full-texts/Abstract-2529.txt\"\n    input_abstract = read_input_file(file_path)\n    reference =  input_abstract  \n    candidate = generated_summary\n\n    scores = compute_rouge(reference, candidate)\n    for key, score in scores.items():\n        print(f\"{key.upper()}:\")\n        print(f\"  Precision: {score.precision:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"  Recall: {score.recall:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"  F1 Score: {score.fmeasure:.4f}\\n\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-10T19:55:49.619462Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-10T19:55:49.619893Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-10T19:55:49.715926Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-10T19:55:49.619862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-10T19:55:49.714702Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"ROUGE1:\n  Precision: 0.2681\n  Recall: 0.6727\n  F1 Score: 0.3834\n\nROUGE2:\n  Precision: 0.1235\n  Recall: 0.3110\n  F1 Score: 0.1768\n\nROUGEL:\n  Precision: 0.1208\n  Recall: 0.3030\n  F1 Score: 0.1727\n\nROUGELSUM:\n  Precision: 0.1208\n  Recall: 0.3030\n  F1 Score: 0.1727\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
