35361633,"Asthma treatment goals currently focus on symptom and exacerbation control rather than remission. Remission is not identical to cure, but is a step closer. This review considers the current definitions of remission in asthma, the prevalence and predictors, the pathophysiology of remission, the possibility of achieving it using the available treatment options, and the future research directions. Asthma remission is characterised by a high level of disease control, including the absence of symptoms and exacerbations, and normalisation or optimisation of lung function with or without ongoing treatment. Even in those who develop a symptomatic remission of asthma, persistent pathological abnormalities are common, leading to a risk of subsequent relapse at any time. Complete remission requires normalisation or stabilisation of any underlying pathology in addition to symptomatic remission. Remission is possible as part of the natural history of asthma, and the prevalence of remission in the adult asthma population varies between 2% and 52%. The factors associated with remission include mild asthma, better lung function, better asthma control, younger age, early-onset asthma, shorter duration of asthma, milder bronchial hyperresponsiveness, fewer comorbidities and smoking cessation or never smoking. Although previous studies have not targeted treatment-induced remission, there is some evidence to show that the current long-term add-on therapies such as biologics and azithromycin can achieve some criteria for asthma remission on treatment, at least in a subgroup of patients. However, more research is required. Long-term remission could be included as a therapeutic goal in studies of asthma treatments."
31690377,"Approximately one-half of children with asthma present with symptoms before 3 years of age. The typical history describes recurrent episodes of wheezing and / or cough triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection (URI), activity, or changes in weather. When symptoms occur after a viral URI, children with asthma often take longer than the usual week to fully recover from their respiratory symptoms. Wheezing and coughing during exercise or during laughing or crying, and episodes triggered in the absence of infection suggest asthma. A trial of bronchodilator medication should show symptomatic improvement. The goal of asthma therapy is to keep children ""symptom free"" by preventing chronic symptoms, maintaining lung function, and allowing for normal daily activities. Avoidance of triggers identified by a history, such as second-hand cigarette smoke exposure, and allergens identified by skin-prick testing can significantly reduce symptoms. According to the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) report, if impairment symptoms are present for > 2 days / week or 2 nights / month, then the disease process is characterized as persistent, and, in all age groups, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended as the preferred daily controller therapy. Montelukast is approved for children ages ≥ 12 months and is often used for its ease of daily oral dosing. Long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists should only be used in combination with an ICS. For more-severe or difficult-to-control phenotypes, biologic therapy has been developed, which targets the type of inflammation present."
31558662,"This document provides clinical recommendations for the management of severe asthma. Comprehensive evidence syntheses, including meta-analyses, were performed to summarise all available evidence relevant to the European Respiratory Society / American Thoracic Society Task Force's questions. The evidence was appraised using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and the results were summarised in evidence profiles. The evidence syntheses were discussed and recommendations formulated by a multidisciplinary Task Force of asthma experts, who made specific recommendations on six specific questions. After considering the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, quality of evidence, feasibility, and acceptability of various interventions, the Task Force made the following recommendations: 1) suggest using anti-interleukin (IL) -5 and anti-IL-5 receptor α for severe uncontrolled adult eosinophilic asthma phenotypes; 2) suggest using a blood eosinophil cut-point ≥ 150 μL-1 to guide anti-IL-5 initiation in adult patients with severe asthma; 3) suggest considering specific eosinophil (≥ 260 μL-1) and exhaled nitric oxide fraction (≥ 19.5 ppb) cut-offs to identify adolescents or adults with the greatest likelihood of response to anti-IgE therapy; 4) suggest using inhaled tiotropium for adolescents and adults with severe uncontrolled asthma despite Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 4-5 or National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) step 5 therapies; 5) suggest a trial of chronic macrolide therapy to reduce asthma exacerbations in persistently symptomatic or uncontrolled patients on GINA step 5 or NAEPP step 5 therapies, irrespective of asthma phenotype; and 6) suggest using anti-IL-4 / 13 for adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and for those with severe corticosteroid-dependent asthma regardless of blood eosinophil levels. These recommendations should be reconsidered as new evidence becomes available."
32767571,"Background: Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management."
30885426,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease, is an autosomal dominant dysplasia of the ectoderm and mesoderm with a variable clinical expression, but near-complete penetrance before the age of 5 years. The estimated incidence is 1 in 3000 births. NF-1 is characterized by collections of neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, and pigmented hamartomas in the iris (Lisch nodules). Pulmonary manifestations of NF-1, which usually include bilateral basal reticulations and apical bullae and cysts, are reported in 10-20% of adult patients. Clinically, neurofibromatosis-associated diffuse lung disease (NF-DLD) usually presents with nonspecific respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, and chronic cough or chest pain, at the time of diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) is highly accurate for the identification and characterization of NF-DLD; it is the most reliable method for the diagnosis of this lung involvement. Various CT findings of NF-DLD, including cysts, bullae, ground-glass opacities, bibasilar reticular opacities, and emphysema, have been described in patients with NF-1. The typical CT pattern, however, is characterized by upper-lobe cystic and bullous disease, and basilar interstitial lung disease. Currently, the goal of NF-DLD treatment is the earliest possible diagnosis, focusing on symptom relief and interventions that positively alter the course of the disease, such as smoking cessation. The aim of this review is to describe the main clinical, pathological, and imaging aspects of NF-1, with a focus on pulmonary involvement."
35820227,"Introduction: Persistent cough with sputum production is an important clinical trait in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We defined ""frequent productive cough"" based on 2 questions from the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and sought to determine its occurrence and associated outcomes in patients with physician-assigned asthma and / or COPD from the NOVELTY study. ""Methods: We analyzed data from the NOVELTY study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of fluticasone furoate / vilanterol (FF / VI) on COPD exacerbations."
33234856,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and will likely be the third most common cause by the end of 2020. It is felt to be caused by repetitive noxious stimuli to the lung, most commonly from smoking, with persistent symptoms of cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. Most patients will have these baseline symptoms, with periodic flare-ups known as exacerbations. This article focuses on pharmacological therapy in a stable COPD patient. Pharmacological treatment of a stable COPD patient focuses on minimizing symptoms, improving exercise tolerance, and preventing exacerbations. Nonpharmacological management of stable COPD, smoking cessation, and treatment of exacerbations are covered in other sections."
31632757,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major chronic debilitating condition with significant impact on quality of life, symptoms, comorbidity, health care utilization and longevity. The main pathophysiological hallmark of COPD is expiratory flow limitation which impairs the ability of respiratory system to adequately and properly ventilate. To be able to prognosticate and manage patients with COPD, various societies have developed classifications of disease severity. Current classification schemes combine three elements that include lung function, patient reported symptoms (shortness of breath) and frequency of exacerbations. Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), an international guideline for diagnosis and management of COPD, started using this approach since the 2011 revision. Management according to this scheme has been developed and is in use. Comprehensive COPD management is multifaceted. It includes pharmacologic management, patient education, smoking cessation, influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, depression and anxiety management, pulmonary rehabilitation, and if indicated, home oxygen therapy. The following chapter will review management recommendations currently in use for stable COPD. We intend to make the chapter to the point and practical and avoid an exhaustive review of the literature."
33292524,"In patients with asthma, the inhalation of elevated amounts of fungal spores and hyphae may precipitate the onset of asthma or worsen control to the extent of being life-threatening. Sensitisation to fungi, especially Aspergillus fumigatus, is found in 15% to 48% of asthmatics in secondary care and is linked to worse asthma control, hospitalisation, bronchiectasis and fixed airflow obstruction, irrespective of whether allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is diagnosed. ABPA represents a florid response to the presence of Aspergillus spp. but up to 70% of patients with severe asthma exhibit sensitisation to different fungi without meeting the diagnostic criteria for ABPA. The presence of persistent endobronchial colonisation with fungi, especially A. fumigatus, is linked to significantly higher rates of radiological abnormalities, lower post-bronchodilator FEV1 and significantly less reversibility to short acting bronchodilators. The therapeutic benefit for antifungal intervention in severe asthma is based on the assumption that reductions in airway fungal burden may result in improvements in asthma control, lung function and symptoms (especially cough). This contention is supported by several prospective studies which demonstrate the effectiveness of antifungals for the treatment of ABPA. Significantly, these studies confirm lower toxicity of treatment with azoles versus high dose oral corticosteroid dosing regimens for ABPA. Here we review recent evidence for the role of fungi in the progression of severe asthma and provide recommendations for the use of antifungal agents in patients with severe asthma, airways fungal infection (mycosis) and fungal colonisation. Documenting fungal airways colonisation and sensitisation in those with severe asthma opens up alternative therapy options of antifungal therapy, which may be particularly valuable in low resource settings."
30484945,"Asthma is a common condition affecting 8.3% of the adult population in the United States. The disease is characterized by chronic airway inflammation that leads to airway hyperresponsiveness and obstruction that results in coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and a feeling of chest tightness. The diagnosis and classification of asthma is based on reported symptoms, physical examination findings, and spirometry. Pharmacologic therapy is prescribed using a stepwise approach that begins with inhaled short-acting beta2 -agonists for intermittent asthma with the addition of daily inhaled corticosteroids for more persistent cases. Individuals with asthma are reevaluated on a regular basis to monitor symptoms, and pharmacologic treatments are adjusted as needed. Familiarity with the stepwise approach for asthma management and confidence in the efficacy and safety profiles of inhaled medications will assist clinicians in successful management of asthma in the primary care setting."
32156662,"Cough in asthma predicts disease severity, prognosis, and is a common and troublesome symptom. Cough is the archetypal airway neuronal reflex, yet little is understood about the underlying neuronal mechanisms. It is generally assumed that symptoms arise because of airway hyper-responsiveness and / or airway inflammation, but despite using inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators targeting these pathologies, a large proportion of patients have persistent coughing. This review focuses on the prevalence and impact of cough in asthma and explores data from pre-clinical and clinical studies which have explored neuronal mechanisms of cough and asthma. We present evidence to suggest patients with asthma have evidence of neuronal dysfunction, which is further heightened and exaggerated by both bronchoconstriction and airway eosinophilia. Identifying patients with excessive coughing with asthma may represent a neuro-phenotype and hence developing treatment for this symptom is important for reducing the burden of disease on patients' lives and currently represents a major unmet clinical need."
32007172,"Asthma is a disease of reversible airflow obstruction characterised clinically by wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. Increases in airway type 2 cytokine activity, including interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13, are now established biological mechanisms in asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids have been the foundation for asthma treatment, in a large part because they decrease airway type 2 inflammation. However, inhaled or systemic corticosteroids are ineffective treatments in many patients with asthma and few treatment options exist for patients with steroid resistant asthma. Although mechanisms for corticosteroid refractory asthma are likely to be numerous, the development of a new class of biologic agents that target airway type 2 inflammation has provided a new model for treating some patients with corticosteroid refractory asthma. The objective of this Therapeutic paper is to summarise the new type 2 therapeutics, with an emphasis on the biological rationale and clinical efficacy of this new class of asthma therapeutics."
28722853,"Asthma typically presents with a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough, and is characterized by underlying chronic airway inflammation. In adults and older children, the diagnoses of asthma can be confirmed by spirometric evaluation, but in preschool children, asthma can be a diagnostic challenge. Recurrent wheezing occurs in a large population of children < 5 years, typically with viral upper respiratory infections, but deciding when this is the initial presentation of asthma is difficult. A careful history, exam, and trigger factors and response to bronchodilator medications, family history can be useful in establishing asthma diagnosis in this age group."
35434004,"Background and objective: Bronchial asthma, a common respiratory disease in children and young adults, is characterized by hyperresponsiveness and reversible narrowing of the airways which manifest clinically as shortness of breath, cough, and / or wheezing. Although its pathogenic mechanism remains unknown, it's known that asthma patients have substantial interindividual variability in drug responsiveness, among which genetic factors play key roles. For improving the understanding of the biological mechanism of asthma and useful recognition of diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and the main purpose of this article is to optimize drug selection by analyzing genes associated with different drug responsiveness in asthmatic patients through the use of genomic techniques."
35387016,"Asthma is a respiratory disease that currently affects around 300 million people worldwide and is defined by coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, mucus overproduction, chest tightness, and expiratory airflow limitation. Increased levels of interleukin 17 (IL-17) have been observed in sputum, nasal and bronchial biopsies, and serum of patients with asthma compared to healthy controls. Patients with higher levels of IL-17 have a more severe asthma phenotype. Biologics are available for T helper 2 (Th2) -high asthmatics, but the Th17-high subpopulation has a relatively low response to these treatments, rendering it a rather severe asthma phenotype to treat. Several experimental models suggest that targeting the IL-17 pathway may be beneficial in asthma. Moreover, as increased activation of the Th17 / IL-17 axis is correlated with reduced inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) sensitivity, targeting the IL-17 pathway might reverse ICS unresponsiveness. In this review, we present and discuss the current knowledge on the role of IL-17 in asthma and its interaction with the Th2 pathway, focusing on the rationale for therapeutic targeting of the IL-17 pathway."
35514240,"Because there is a solid pharmacological rationale based on positive interactions between long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting β-agonists (LABAs) for their ability to relax human airway smooth muscle in vitro alongside several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world observational studies that support the use of LAMA / LABA fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) for the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in this narrative review we discuss the preclinical and clinical proofs supporting the use of LAMA + LABA therapy in COPD and why this therapeutic approach optimises bronchodilation. Robust evidence indicates that all LAMA / LABA FDCs are consistently more effective than LAMA or LABA administered alone in improving lung function, dyspnoea, quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with COPD. However, the ability of dual bronchodilation with FDCs of LAMA / LABA to prevent or reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations remains unclear due to conflicting data from large RCTs, despite several mechanisms explaining why such combinations should be of value in decreasing the frequency of COPD exacerbations. Both LABAs and LAMAs mechanistically can affect the cardiovascular system, but from clinical studies to date, LAMA / LABA FDCs have an acceptable cardiovascular safety profile, at least in the COPD population enrolled in RCTs. Indirect evidence suggests that some FDCs may even exert a protective role against serious cardiovascular adverse events compared to monotherapies. Consequently, several LAMA / LABA FDCs have been developed and approved for clinical use as treatments for patients with COPD. However, to date, there are unfortunately very few head-to-head studies comparing the safety and efficacy of different LAMA / LABA FDCs, making it difficult to choose the most appropriate combination, although the use of meta-analyses has provided some information in this regard.

35722499,"When a child with severe asthma (asthma defined clinically for the purposes of this review as wheeze, breathlessness, and chest tightness sometimes with cough) does not respond to treatment, it is important to be sure that an alternative or additional diagnosis is not being missed. In school age children, the next step is a detailed protocolized assessment to determine the nature of the problem, whether within the airway or related to co-morbidities or social / environmental factors, in order to personalize the treatment. For example, those with refractory difficult asthma due to persistent non-adherence may benefit from using budesonide and formoterol combined in a single inhaler [single maintenance and reliever treatment (SMART)] as both a reliever and preventer. For those with steroid-resistant Type 2 airway inflammation, the use of biologicals such as omalizumab and mepolizumab should be considered, but for mepolizumab at least, there is a paucity of pediatric data. Protocols are less well developed in preschool asthma, where steroid insensitive disease is much more common, but the use of two simple measurements, aeroallergen sensitization, and peripheral blood eosinophil count, allows the targeted use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). There is also increasing evidence that chronic airway infection may be important in preschool wheeze, increasing the possibility that targeted antibiotics may be beneficial. Asthma in the first year of life is not driven by Type 2 inflammation, so beyond avoiding prescribing ICSs, no evidence based recommendations can be made. In the future, we urgently need to develop objective biomarkers, especially of risk, so that treatment can be targeted effectively; we need to address the scandal of the lack of data in children compared with adults, precluding making evidence-based therapeutic decisions and move from guiding treatment by phenotypes, which will change as the environment changes, to endotype based therapy."
31870229,"Smoking is a major risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and lung cancer. Tobacco smoke (TS) causes bronchitis, emphysema, persistent cough, and dyspnea. Smoking cessation minimizes risks of TS-related disease. To determine whether smoking cessation could reverse TS-induced pulmonary changes, 10-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats were exposed to TS or filtered air (FA) for 39 weeks and allowed to live out their normal lifespan. Significantly (P ≤.05) decreased survival was noted by 21 months in TS versus FA rats. In TS rats, persistent peribronchiolar, perivascular, alveolar, and subpleural inflammation were observed with pervasive infiltration of pigmented foamy macrophages and plausible intra-alveolar fibrosis and osseous metaplasia. Alveolar airspace was significantly (P ≤.05) increased in TS versus FA rats as was the volume of stored epithelial mucosubstances in the left central axial airway. Increased mucin contributes to airflow obstruction and increased lung infection risks. Findings suggest TS-induced changes do not attenuate with smoking cessation but result in irreversible damage similar to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The observed persistent pulmonary changes mirror common TS effects such as chest congestion, sputum production, and shortness of breath long after smoking cessation and represent important targets for treatment of former smokers."
32356609,"Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with cough, sputum production or dyspnoea, and a reduction in lung function, quality of life, and life expectancy. Apart from smoking cessation, no other treatments that slow lung function decline are available. Roflumilast and cilomilast are oral phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE ₄) inhibitors proposed to reduce the airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction seen in COPD. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2011, and was updated in 2017 and 2020."
33658776,"Purpose: Spirometry is necessary to confirm COPD, but many patients are diagnosed based on clinical presentation and / or chest x-ray. There are also those who do not present to primary care for case finding and remain undiagnosed. We aimed to identify: (a) factors that are associated with undiagnosed COPD; and (b) factors that are associated with a potential misdiagnosis of COPD. (2). (3).). (4.).)."
35272071,Background: The identification of patients at high risk for diseases provides clinicians essential information to better manage such patients. Persistent chronic cough (PCC) is a condition with high clinical burden and limited knowledge of the risk factors that drive the persistent symptoms. (1) The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for PCC in patients with chronic cough. (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of patients with chronic cough. (3) Results: A total of 524 patients were included in the study.

32361292,"Background: Asthma is one of the most common chronic inflammatory conditions of the lungs in modern society. Asthma is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling of the airways, with typical symptoms of cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. Interleukins (IL) play an integral role in its inflammatory pathogenesis. Medicinal herbs and secondary metabolites are gaining considerable attention due to their potential therapeutic role and pharmacological mechanisms as adjunct tools to synthetic bronchodilator drugs."

(2) Results: A total of 12 children with PB were included in this study. (1) Conclusion: PB is a rare disease in children, and the diagnosis is often delayed."
33536746,"Asthma is a complex heterogeneous disease defined by chronic inflammation of the airways. Patients present with wheezing, chest tightness, cough and shortness of breath. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness and variable expiratory airflow limitation are hallmark features. About 3.6-6.1% of patients, despite receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a second controller medication, report persistent symptoms referred to as severe asthma. Uncontrolled severe asthma is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, diminished quality of life and increased health expenditures. The development of modern biological therapy has revolutionized severe asthma treatment. By targeting specific chemokines, asthma control has drastically improved, resulting in better quality of life, less emergency department visits and inpatient admissions, and decreased chronic systemic corticosteroid utilization. Despite these advances, there remains a subset of asthma patients who remain symptomatic with poor quality of life and heavy utilization of the healthcare system. Recently attention has been given to pharmaceutical therapy directed at receptors and cytokines on the epithelial layer of the lung referred to as ""alarmins"". Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin-7-like receptor family found on the epithelial layer of the lung that releases a cytokine cascade inducing eosinophilic inflammation, mucus production and airflow obstruction in asthmatics. Tezepelumab is the first investigational monoclonal antibody that inhibits TSLP. Proof of concept study and phase IIb studies demonstrated reduced asthma exacerbations, improvement in quality of life, less decline in FEV1 and decrease in biochemical inflammatory markers in comparison to placebo. It is presently undergoing three phase III studies and an additional phase II study."
35015269,"Introduction: Previous studies have reported that more patients receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) -containing therapies than would be expected based on exacerbation history, suggesting overprescribing. We aimed to describe patterns of treatment switching from first (1MT) to second maintenance therapy (2MT) among COPD patients in the US and UK. (1) Methods: We used data from the COPD Foundation Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to identify COPD patients who received ICS-containing therapies between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015."
31710455,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disease characterized by cough, dyspnea, and sputum production caused by inhalation of harmful chemicals, such as tobacco smoke. COPD should be suspected in patients with a significant smoking history, shortness of breath, and sputum production. The diagnosis is made by spirometry. A forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration to forced vital capacity (FEV1 / FVC) ratio of less than 0.7 after bronchodilator administration confirms the diagnosis. Therapy for patients with stable COPD should include a bronchodilator, either a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). For patients who continue to experience dyspnea with a single bronchodilator, dual therapy with a LABA and LAMA is appropriate. For patients with continued exacerbations, inhaled corticosteroids can be added to LABA-LAMA therapy. Acute exacerbations are characterized by a worsening of symptoms that requires additional therapy. Short-acting beta2-agonists with or without short-acting muscarinic antagonists are the basic therapy for acute exacerbations of COPD. Systemic glucocorticoids have been shown to shorten exacerbations and improve lung function. Antibiotics have been shown to reduce rates of treatment failure and sputum purulence. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is preferred for patients with respiratory failure."
32375966,"Background: Emotional disorders, including depression and anxiety, are more prevalent in individuals with asthma than in the general population and are associated with poor asthma outcomes. Identification of patients with increased levels of stress and anxiety may be helpful when treating asthma and during asthma counseling. Objective: To further characterize the relationship between asthma symptoms and perceived stress and trait anxiety in an adolescent population. Methods: Adolescents (N = 335) ages 14-17 years were recruited to examine the effect of stress on health measures. They were included in the present analysis if they reported current asthma, defined as self-reported clinician-diagnosed asthma plus one or more episodes of asthma in the past year. Asthma symptoms were assessed on a 7-point scale by using a standardized questionnaire that targets nocturnal awakening due to asthma, symptoms on awakening, activity limitation, shortness of breath, time spent wheezing, and short-acting bronchodilator use. Stress was measured by using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and trait anxiety was measured by using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Linear regression was used to associate asthma symptoms with PSS and trait anxiety. Results: Thirty-eight adolescents (11.3%), with mean ± standard deviation age 16.7 ± 0.9 years, reported current asthma. Four of the six asthma symptom assessments had significant associations with PSS: symptoms on awakening (β = 4.82, p < 0.001), nocturnal awakening due to asthma (β = 4.47, p < 0.001), activity limitation (β = 2.78, p = 0.005), and shortness of breath (β = 1.73, p = 0.014). These associations remained significant after adjusting for gender, race, and the body mass index percentile. Trait anxiety had significant associations with nocturnal awakening (β = 9.28, p = 0.002) and symptoms on awakening (β = 8.74, p = 0.002). Associations remained significant after adjusting for gender, race, and body mass index percentile. Conclusion: Asthma symptom severity is associated with increased perceived stress and trait anxiety. Adolescents with asthma may represent a population that is particularly vulnerable to perceived stress and anxiety, which highlights the importance of considering these factors in asthma counseling."
36279253,"Objective: This study aims to investigate the presence of underlying chronic airway disease in individuals with chronic cough and dyspnea lasting longer than eight weeks and who had previously Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and had no known lung disease.Methods: A total of 151 patients admitted to the respiratory diseases outpatient room with the complaint of cough and / or dyspnea that persisted for at least eight weeks following COVID-19 infection were accrued to the study. Demographic characteristics, smoking history, the severity of lung involvement on chest computed tomography in the acute phase of Covid-19 infection, and bronchodilator reversibility test results were recorded. Smoking history and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) were compared.Results: FEV1 increase ≥ 200 ml was observed in 40 (26.5%) patients. In 24 (15.9%) patients, an increase in FEV1 was found to be 200 ml and above, and the percentage of FEV1 was 12% or more. While 14 (9.3%) patients were diagnosed with asthma, 13 (8.6%) patients were diagnosed with nonreversible airflow obstruction (NRAO), and 1 (0.7%) patient was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Conclusions: COVID-19 infection may play a vital role in initiating asthma pathogenesis. It should be kept in mind that viral infection-related asthma may be the underlying cause of prolonged cough and dyspnea after COVID-19 infection."

35861997,"Basic lung and heart ultrasound examination combined with chest X-ray (TUSX) is currently considered to be very useful for differentiation of asthma, chronic bronchitis and laryngeal paralysis from other diseases with dyspnea / coughing. Among 252 client-owned animals with persistent dyspnea / cough / noisy breathing, in 197 of them: pulmonary edema, pneumonia, lung cancer, free pleural fluid, pneumothorax, lung contusion or heart disease were diagnosed. The remaining 55 animals (42 dogs and 13 cats) were diagnosed with asthma (in 13 cats), chronic bronchitis (in 37 dogs) and laryngeal paralysis (in 5 dogs) using TUSX. These animals were qualified for inhaled fluticasone treatment using 3 types of spacers - two commercial and a home- -made mask. 36 animals (65.5%) completed the trail. In 26 of them (72.2%) the owners observed complete, long lasting relief of the symptoms, and the owners of 7 animals (19.5%) declared a considerable clinical improvement, regardless of the type of spacer used. The owners of 3 animals (8.3%) did not see any improvement. The proposed diagnostic and therapeutic management improved long-term clinical status of the vast majority (91.7%) of animals. Therefore, it seems justified to include the TUSX diagnostic protocol in daily veterinary practice and to encourage owners to prepare home-made face masks for inhaled fluticasone treatment."
37160771,"Purpose: Chronic cough (cough that persists for ≥ 8 weeks) can cause a range of physical symptoms and psychosocial effects that significantly impair patients' quality of life. Refractory chronic cough (RCC) and unexplained chronic cough (UCC) are challenging to diagnose and manage, with substantial economic implications for healthcare systems. (1) The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of RCC and UCC in a large cohort of patients with chronic cough and to identify the most common causes of cough."
36252915,Background: The beneficial effects of application of a fixed dose beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and formoterol fumarate (F) for the treatment of severe chronic obstructive disease (COPD) has been amply proven in well controlled clinical trials. Whether this also holds for real-world conditions and in such a heterogeneous patient population as is encountered in Bulgaria remained to be investigated. (1) The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of BDP / F in a real-world setting in Bulgaria.
30808365,"Background: Cough variant asthma (CVA) is one of the most common causes of chronic persistent cough, and early treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) is recommended to attenuate the inflammation and remodeling. The impulse oscillometry system (IOS) is a novel device for respiratory functional assessment that has not yet been assessed in terms of CVA. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between CVA and IOS, and the difference in therapeutic effects of ICSs among the subtype classifications by IOS."
30931183,"Introduction Smoking is one of the leading causes of death. Smoking also decreases lung efficiency and impairs lung function in children of all ages. Second-hand tobacco smoking increases both the frequency and severity of childhood asthma. However, the role of active tobacco smoking in the manifestation of asthma remains inconclusive. The aim of this article was to describe the current understanding of the prevalence and adverse effects of cigarette smoking and to determine whether there is an association between smoking and the manifestation and progression of asthma among adolescents and high school students in Russia. Objectives This study aimed to determine the true prevalence of bronchial asthma (BA), allergic rhinitis (AR), and atopic dermatitis (AD) in the population of adolescents in the Russian Federation. In the GA2LEN (Global Allergy and Asthma European Network) study, we analyzed participant responses to confirm a connection between smoking and asthma exacerbation or development. This study examined the association between parental smoking and childhood atopic disorders. We sought to determine the effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and childhood cigarette smoking on asthma symptoms among high school and college students in Moscow, Russia. We analyzed the reactions to the present tobacco control policy and evaluated the significance of the success of the policy. A number of methods were used, including questionnaires, surveys, and statistical analysis software. Results Our research indicates a moderate decrease in smoking prevalence among Russian teenagers. From the data and results of our study, 25.3% of the respondents said that they have ever smoked for as long as a year. Among the participants who had ever smoked, most of them started smoking at the age of 16 years while the state-reported average age for a new smoker is 11.4. Fifty percent of the respondents who had shortness of breath had been woken by an attack once a week in the last three months. Only 21.1% of the people with asthma were taking medicines for it. According to our calculations, there is no significant association between smoking status and the prevalence of asthma, hay fever, and sinusitis. More respondents (34.2%) had fathers who regularly smoked during their childhood than mothers who regularly smoked during their childhood or before the children were born (7.9%). There is a statistically significant association between a mother smoking during childhood or before the birth of a child and that child being hospitalized before the age of two years for lung disease. Conclusion The fact that the smoking rates among study participants are relatively low is quite encouraging and anti-smoking campaigns should be intensified to drive the rates lower. The data analyzed do not provide sufficient evidence to show that there is any causative association between smoking status and asthma"
36872445,"Background: Chronic cough is reported in up to 20% of the adult population and often persists despite medical treatment with currently available therapies. Many clinical conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), must be excluded before making a Unexplained chronic cough diagnosis. Methods: The primary objective was to use a large hospital dataset to compare clinical features of patients with a primary diagnosis of UCC with those with asthma or COPD without a primary diagnosis of UCC to help clinicians differentiate between these conditions more readily. Data were collected for all hospitalization and outpatient medical encounters for each patient between November 2013 and December 2018. Information included demographics, encounter dates, medications prescribed at every encounter for chronic cough, lung function testing, and hematologic parameters. Asthma and COPD were combined into one group to ensure there was no overlap with UCC and due to limitations of International Classification of Diseases coding to confirm an asthma (A) / COPD diagnosis. Results: Female gender represented 70% of encounters for UCC versus 61.8% for asthma / COPD (p < 0.0001); the mean age was 56.9 years for UCC versus 50.1 years for A / COPD (p < 0.0001). The number of patients on cough medications and the cough medication frequency were significantly higher in the UCC versus A / COPD group (p < 0.0001). UCC versus A / COPD patients had a total of eight versus three cough-related encounters over the study duration (i.e., 5 years) (< 0.0001). The average interval between successive encounters was less for UCC (114 days) versus the A / COPD (288 days) group. Gender-adjusted Forced expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation / Forced vital capacity (FEV1 / FVC) ratios, residual volume%, and Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) were significantly higher in UCC versus A / COPD, whereas the response to bronchodilators of FEV1, FVC and residual volumes were significantly greater in A / COPD patients. Conclusions: Clinical characteristics differentiating UCC from A / COPD could accelerate recognition of UCC diagnosis especially in the subspecialty setting where patients with these disorders are referred."
36642495,"Cough is a common symptom in the acute phase of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection, and some patients may develop persistent cough (subacute cough or even chronic cough), which affects the quality of life. Currently, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still widespread in China. In order to guide physicians on the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2-associated cough, the Asthma Group of the Chinese Thoracic Society and the National Centre for Respiratory Medicine organized relevant experts to develop the Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-associated Cough. This consensus includes five parts: epidemiology and pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment and outlook.The incidence of acute cough is 44% -72.5%, and about one third is productive cough. Current data shows that the average duration of cough is proximately 2 weeks, but in some patients, cough could last longer, even up to several months. SARS-CoV-2 infection cough is associated with airway epithelial damage, immunogenic or neurogenic inflammation, airway mucus hypersecretion, and cough hypersensitivity (peripheral or central).The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated cough in acute phase relies on epidemiological history, clinical characteristics, physical examination, and SARS-CoV-2 antigen or nucleic acid tests. It is also important to distinguish it from cough following other respiratory infections. The patients in acute and subacute phases of cough are currently treated symptomatically, by using cough suppressants and expectorants according to the types of the cough. For patients with severe cough, central or peripheral cough suppressants can be used. Combined first-generation antihistamines / decongestants (A / D preparations) are recommended. Anti-viral treatment such as Paxlovid is used in severe patients or patients who are likely to develop severe conditions. Anti-bacterial treatment is not recommended except for patients with bacterial infectious traits. Inhaled corticosteroids or corticosteroids plus long acting beta agonists or leukotriene antagonists are only used for patients with wheezing, or those who have asthma or allergy history, or who have evidence of eosinophilic inflammation or who are refractory to antitussive treatment. Patients who have chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD or asthma should maintain the regular treatments. With regard to TCM treatment, effectiveness is indicated both in the acute phase or non-acute phase based on clinical practice, and collection of more evidence on this aspect is also under way.There is limited data on SARS-CoV-2-associated cough in regard of epidemiology, pathogenesis, features of cough, diagnosis"
35914802,"A man in his 60s exhibited persistent dry cough and dyspnoea, which persisted even after smoking cessation. Chest high-resolution CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities in the subpleural areas of both lungs. He underwent bronchoscopy, but no definitive diagnosis could be made. Histopathological analysis of the specimen obtained by surgical lung biopsy showed a desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) pattern, with lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates in the alveolar septa; the ratio of IgG and IgG4-positive cells was more than 90%. He quit smoking, but the radiological findings worsened. Based on the pathological findings, we diagnosed the patient with DIP due to IgG4-related lung disease. Prednisolone was initiated, and the symptoms and radiological findings improved."
30458908,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to describe the case of a 43-year-old male with asthma who was hospitalized for an exacerbation of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB), a chronic lung disease that is characterized by dilation of the airways, persistent cough, chronic sputum production, and recurrent respiratory infections. He was treated with oral and inhaled antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators, and aggressive airway-clearance techniques including nebulized 7% sodium chloride, flutter valve, and high-frequency chest wall oscillation. SETTINGS: Community pharmacy, nursing facility pharmacy, consultant pharmacy practice. PRACTICE CONSIDERATIONS: As the number of patients diagnosed with NCFB continues to increase, it is crucial to recognize that specific guidance for management of NCFB is warranted, as treatment responses differ from cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CONCLUSION: It is important for pharmacists to understand the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for NCFB to better assist physicians and patients and improve therapeutic outcomes."

32479149,"Approximately 12 million adults in the United States receive a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) each year, and it is the fourth leading cause of death. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow obstruction and a constellation of symptoms, including cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoke, but other environmental exposures also may contribute. The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 2020 Report aims to provide a nonbiased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COPD. To date, no conclusive evidence exists that any existing medications for COPD modify mortality. The mainstay of treatment for COPD is inhaled bronchodilators, whereas the role of inhaled corticosteroids is less clear. Inhaled corticosteroids have substantial risks, including an increased risk for pneumonia. Here, 2 experts, both pulmonologists, reflect on the care of a woman with severe COPD, a 50-pack-year smoking history, frequent COPD exacerbations, and recurrent pneumonia. They consider the indications for inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, when inhaled corticosteroids should be withdrawn, and what other treatments are available."
30550210,"Objective: To explore the application of lung function and exhaled nitric oxide in the evaluation of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with or without polyps who denied bronchial asthma history and planned to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery. Method: Two hundred and thirty-two patients with CRS during April 2016 to April 2018 in our hospital were recruited in this study. All patients accepted lung function and exhaled nitric oxide test before surgery to evaluate whether accompanied with asthma, improvements after standardized drug therapy in patients with asthma. SpO ₂, Ppeak and PETCO ₂ were monitored and recorded during surgery. Postoperative symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough were also observed and recorded. Result: ① Of the 232 patients, 18 patients were diagnosed as bronchial asthma, with a positive rate of 7.8%. 17 cases had positive results in bronchodilation test, 1 case was negative whose PEF improvement rate was 40.4%; The mean FeNO of the 18 patients was 46 ppb, of which 16 patients whose FeNO was over 25 ppb; The mean FeNO of 40 cases with normal pulmonary function was over 25ppb, of which 4 cases' FeNO were over 50 ppb; ② 232 patients' intraopertive anesthesia monitor showed that SpO ₂ were greater than 95%, Ppeak were less than 35 cmH ₂ O, PETCO ₂ were greater than 35 mmHg; ③ Mild dyspnea occurred in a patients diagnosed as asthma the next morning after surgery. The auscultation was scattered in the wheezing sound, and the symptoms were relieved in 10 minutes after inhalation of salmeterol. Conclusion: Routine screening for lung function and FeNO and standardized perioperative treatment in patients with CRS before nasal endoscopy is useful."

34844966,"Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop multisystemic clinical manifestations, the minority having mild or atypical symptoms. We describe an adolescent with chronic cough and purulent rhinorrhoea since the first year of life, with diagnoses of asthma, allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. Under therapy with long-acting bronchodilators, antihistamines, inhaled corticosteroids, antileukotrienes and several courses of empirical oral antibiotic therapy, there was no clinical improvement. There was no reference to gastrointestinal symptoms. Due to clinical worsening, extended investigations were initiated, which revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum culture, sweat test with a positive result and heterozygosity for F508del and R334W mutations in genetic study which allowed to confirm the diagnosis of CF. In this case, heterozygosity with a class IV mutation can explain the atypical clinical presentation. It is very important to consider this diagnosis when chronic symptoms persist, despite optimised therapy for other respiratory pathologies and in case of isolation of atypical bacterial agents."

Clinical can improve symptoms, but cannot be cured; glucocorticoid is the most important first-line medication. Clinical practice has shown that montelukast sodium combined with fluticasone in the treatment of adult BA can improve clinical efficacy and reduce adverse reactions. The purpose of this study is to systematically study the efficacy and safety of montelukast sodium combined with fluticasone in the treatment of adult BA."
36759235,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are widely used for the treatment of various malignant neoplasms. Interstitial lung disease is a well-known immune-related adverse event, however, ICI-induced airway disease remains under-recognized. Herein, we report two similar cases of pembrolizumab-induced tracheobronchitis presenting as persistent chronic cough and dyspnea. Blood tests revealed elevated C-reactive protein levels without eosinophilia. Spirometry demonstrated mild airflow obstruction. Computed tomography revealed diffuse thickening of the tracheobronchial walls and bronchiectasis predominantly in the lower lobes. Bronchoscopy revealed edematous and erythematous tracheobronchial mucosa, and bronchial biopsy tissue exhibited marked inflammation with predominant infiltration of CD8 + lymphocytes. Subsequently, pembrolizumab-induced tracheobronchitis was diagnosed in both cases. Cessation of pembrolizumab and initiation of erythromycin, inhaled corticosteroids, and long-acting beta-agonists gradually improved the symptoms, airflow obstruction, and radiographic findings. These were completely resolved in one case. The other case initially showed a poor response to systemic corticosteroids combined with the aforementioned drugs, but improved gradually and almost completely. These cases exemplify ICI-induced airway disease that is, an under-recognized manifestation of immune-related adverse events. In addition, we have systematically searched the PubMed database for articles on ICI-induced airway disease, categorized the retrieved articles as eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic airway diseases, and reviewed the differences in treatment and prognoses between these two categories."
36472185,"Checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) is a relatively rare adverse event and a potential cause of death in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Because the symptoms and signs are nonspecific, the diagnosis of CIP is challenging. Additionally, compared with the biomarkers that can monitor the effect of ICIs, there is less research evaluating markers to monitor CIP. We report a case of CIP induced by camrelizumab in a patient with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, in which the fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels showed obvious increases. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide may have the potential to monitor the condition of airway inflammation in patients using ICIs."
35658804,"Objective: Asthma is characterized by reversible pulmonary symptoms, frequent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and varied treatment. Parents with low health literacy (HL) is linked to poor asthma outcomes in children. Recent practice updates recommended inhaled corticosteroids for the management of persistent asthma, but guideline-concordant care is suboptimal. Our aim was to develop and assess an Asthma Action Plan (AAP) that could serve as an individualized plan for low HL families and facilitate guideline-concordant care for clinicians."
32742882,"Neurofibromatosis-1 or von Recklinghausen's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder. Cafe au lait macules are generally the initial presenting feature of the disease, and there can be varying degrees of involvement of the skeletal, neurological, and pulmonary organ systems as the disease progresses. The existence of neurofibromatosis-associated diffuse lung disease (NF-DLD) as a separate entity has always been questioned and, is often attributed to cigarette smoking, rather than a manifestation of NF-1. A 59-year-old male with a history of neurofibromatosis presented with shortness of breath and ataxia for 10 days. Exam findings were pertinent for tachycardia, tachypnea, and diffuse cutaneous neurofibromas. Workup showed white blood count (WBC) of 15.9 k / ul, electrocardiogram with biatrial enlargement and right axis deviation, and a chest X-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate concerning for pneumonia. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed left basilar consolidation with surrounding ground-glass opacities and innumerable bilateral thin-walled cysts. The latter finding raised suspicion for NF-DLD. The patient was evaluated by pulmonology with recommendations to continue treatment for pneumonia and follow-up with high-resolution CT of the chest and complete pulmonary function testing in 12 weeks. He was discharged in a stable condition after five days of hospitalization. NF-DLD is a pulmonary manifestation of NF-1 with non-specific respiratory symptoms and a characteristic pattern of upper lobe cystic and basilar interstitial lung disease. It usually presents in the 4th or 5th decade, earlier in tobacco users, but a few pediatric cases have also been reported. The presentation of NF-DLD can be variable, ranging from dyspnea, chest pain, chronic cough, hemoptysis, or an incidental finding on CT. Multiple complications, including spontaneous pneumothorax due to the rupture of subpleural blebs, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic respiratory failure, are associated with NF-DLD. NF-DLD can be prevented by smoking cessation but, there are no known modalities for treatment; however, complications can be managed symptomatically. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge that NF-DLD represents to clinicians. The patient's CT from two years ago showed emphysematous changes along with scattered fibrosis and scarring, and no cystic changes were mentioned, unlike his latest CT, which showed innumerable cysts. This patient had a history of smoking, which likely put him at a higher risk for the development of cysts. However, he quit smoking 10 years prior, which suggests that his lung changes are not secondary to"
30737366,"BACKGROUND Bronchiolitis obliterans is the term used to describe a clinical syndrome of irreversible airflow obstruction. Among the etiologies linked to this entity is the rarely reported association with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which has had a poor outcome in most of the previously published cases. The optimum management of bronchiolitis obliterans as a complication of Stevens-Johnson syndrome is not well defined. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman developed significant shortness of breath 3 months after recovering from Stevens-Johnson syndrome precipitated by a second-generation cephalosporin. She was found to have severe irreversible airway obstruction on physiology studies, and computed tomography scans of the inspiratory and expiratory phases of respiration showed air trapping that was more prominent on expiratory films. The patient was diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans, for which bronchodilators and long-term macrolide therapy were administered. Although she did not recover completely, her follow-up physiology studies showed that the bronchiolitis obliterans was stable. CONCLUSIONS Bronchiolitis obliterans secondary to Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare entity that is progressive and can lead to functional impairment. Identifying the disease at an early stage might stabilize or slow its progression. Herein, we describe a case of bronchiolitis obliterans as a complication of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and review the literature to raise awareness of this condition, highlight its course, and discuss the available treatments."

Laboratory investigations have demonstrated that at low plasma concentrations (1-5 mg / l) theophylline markedly enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids in COPD. (1) We have investigated the effects of theophylline on the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids in COPD."
33461602,"Objectives: Basic and clinical studies have shown that magnesium sulphate ameliorates lung injury and controls asthma attacks by anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects. Both intravenous and inhaled magnesium sulphate have a clinical impact on acute severe asthma by inhibition of airway smooth muscle contraction. Besides, magnesium sulphate can dilate constricted pulmonary arteries and reduce pulmonary artery resistance. However, it may affect systemic arteries when administered intravenously. A large number of patients with covid-19 admitted to the hospital suffer from pulmonary involvement. COVID-19 can cause hypoxia due to the involvement of the respiratory airways and parenchyma along with circulatory impairment, which induce ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This condition may result in hypoxemia and low arterial blood oxygen pressure and saturation presented with some degree of dyspnoea and shortness of breath. Inhaled magnesium sulphate as a smooth muscle relaxant (natural calcium antagonist) can cause both bronchodilator and consequently vasodilator effects (via a direct effect on alveolar arterioles in well-ventilated areas) in the respiratory tract. We aim to investigate if inhaled magnesium sulphate as adjuvant therapy to standard treatment can reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the respiratory tract and subsequently improve arterial oxygen saturation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19."
30217958,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) is a lipid kinase involved in leukocyte recruitment and activation. Activation of PI3Kδ has been linked to airway inflammation and asthma pathogenesis. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study investigated the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a PI3Kδ inhibitor, nemiralisib (GSK2269557), in patients with persistent, uncontrolled asthma. Patients (n = 50) received once-daily inhaled nemiralisib (1000 µg) or placebo for 28 days, with a crossover to the alternative treatment following a 4-week washout period. Spirometry demonstrated no discernible difference in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline (adjusted posterior median 7 ml; 95% credible interval -83, 102 ml) between nemiralisib and placebo treatment at day 28 (primary endpoint). These results were supported by most secondary endpoints, including weighted mean FEV1 (0-4 hours) and change in trough forced vital capacity at day 28. Nemiralisib was generally well-tolerated, with few side effects except for post-inhalation cough (nemiralisib: 35%; placebo: 9%). At day 14, sputum interleukin (IL) -5, IL-13, IL-6, and IL-8 levels were reduced by a median of 17%, 7%, 15%, and 8%, respectively, when comparing nemiralisib with placebo [n = 15 (IL-5, IL-8) or 16 (IL-6, IL-13); posterior probability of a true ratio > 0%: 78%, 64%, 76%, and 63%, respectively]. These results suggest that nemiralisib inhibited PI3Kδ locally; however, this did not translate into meaningful clinical improvement. Further studies will investigate the potential efficacy of nemiralisib in patients with asthma with other specific more severe phenotypes, including those who are colonized with bacteria and frequently exacerbate."

34093730,"We present a case of critical airway obstruction secondary to a solid tracheal mucus plug in a patient with pneumonia. Following failed conventional mucolysis therapy, nebulised N-acetylcysteine acted as a life-saving mucolytic, and prevented imminent cardiorespiratory arrest. Use of oral N-acetylcysteine as a mucolytic has been long established within respiratory medicine in managing chronic airway disease, but is rarely utilised in critically ill or mechanically ventilated patients due to the lack of comparative studies in literature. A 28-year-old female presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and a productive cough. She was six weeks post-partum with no past medical history. Initial management for a community acquired pneumonia with type 1 respiratory failure included intensive care admission, antibiotics, fluid therapy and bronchodilators. The patient acutely deteriorated 48 h after admission becoming unresponsive and severely hypoxaemic. Intubation did not achieve ventilation, and subsequent direct bronchoscopy revealed a thick, solid, obstructing tracheal mucus plug, superior to the carina. It was resistant to aspiration despite the use of saline flushes, chest physiotherapy and bronchodilators and the bronchoscope could not pass it. N-acetylcysteine, administered via the bronchoscopic port, caused sufficient mucolysis to enable removal of the thick mucus cast, enabling ventilation and gas exchange. Such resistant mucus plugging is a rare cause of failed ventilation, with limited therapeutic options. Here, the unlicensed and rarely reported use of nebulised N-acetylcysteine was a life-saving mucolytic, allowing removal of the obstructing plug and re-establishing ventilation."
33325455,"This position paper has been drafted by experts from the Czech national board of diseases with bronchial obstruction, of the Czech Pneumological and Phthisiological Society. The statements and recommendations are based on both the results of randomized controlled trials and data from cross-sectional and prospective real-life studies to ensure they are as close as possible to the context of daily clinical practice and the current health care system of the Czech Republic. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable heterogeneous syndrome with a number of pulmonary and extrapulmonary clinical features and concomitant chronic diseases. The disease is associated with significant mortality, morbidity and reduced quality of life. The main characteristics include persistent respiratory symptoms and only partially reversible airflow obstruction developing due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Oxidative stress, protease-antiprotease imbalance and increased numbers of pro-inflammatory cells (mainly neutrophils) are the main drivers of primarily non-infectious inflammation in COPD. Besides smoking, household air pollution, occupational exposure, low birth weight, frequent respiratory infections during childhood and also genetic factors are important risk factors of COPD development. Progressive airflow limitation and airway remodelling leads to air trapping, static and dynamic hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities and decreased exercise capacity. Various features of the disease are expressed unequally in individual patients, resulting in various types of disease presentation, emerging as the ""clinical phenotypes"" (for specific clinical characteristics) and ""treatable traits"" (for treatable characteristics) concept. The estimated prevalence of COPD in Czechia is around 6.7% with 3,200-3,500 deaths reported annually. The elementary requirements for diagnosis of COPD are spirometric confirmation of post-bronchodilator airflow obstruction (post-BD FEV1 / VCmax < 70%) and respiratory symptoms assessement (dyspnoea, exercise limitation, cough and / or sputum production. In order to establish definite COPD diagnosis, a five-step evaluation should be performed, including: 1 / inhalation risk assessment, 2 / symptoms evaluation, 3 / lung function tests, 4 / laboratory tests and 5 / imaging. At the same time, all alternative diagnoses should be excluded. For disease classification, this position paper uses both GOLD stages (1 to 4), GOLD groups (A to D) and evaluation of clinical phenotype (s). Prognosis assessment should be done in each patient. For this purpose, we recommend the use of the BODE or the CADOT index. Six elementary clinical phenotypes are recognized, including chronic bronchitis, frequent exacerbator, emphysematous, asthma / COPD overlap (ACO), bronchiectases with or"
30829895,"Background: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a novel bronchoscopic therapy for severe uncontrolled asthma unresponsive to standard pharmacological treatments, including inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-2 agonists. Although several studies have shown that BT improves asthma control, the optimal predictors of BT response remain unknown. (1) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent BT for severe uncontrolled asthma at our institution between January 2014 and December 2017. (2) Results: A total of 21 patients (mean age, 54.7 ± 12.6 years; male, 71.4%) were included."
34763643,"In medical literature, increasing attention is paid to comorbidities in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In clinical practice, physicians often hesitate to prescribe beta-blockers (β1-adrenoblockers) to COPD patients. This article summarized new results of using beta-blockers in patients with COPD. According to reports, the selective β1-blocker treatment considerably increases the survival rate of patients with COPD and ischemic heart disease, particularly after myocardial infarction (MI), and with chronic heart failure (CHF). The benefit of administering selective β1-blockers to patients with CHF and / or a history of MI overweighs a potential risk related with the treatment even in patients with severe COPD. Convincing data in favor of the β1-blocker treatment in COPD patients without the above-mentioned comorbidities are not available. At present, the selective β1-blocker treatment is considered safe for patients with cardiovascular diseases and COPD. For this reason, selective β1-blockers, such as bisoprolol, metoprolol or nebivolol can be used in managing this patient cohort. Nonselective β1-blockers may induce bronchospasm and are not recommended for COPD patients. For the treatment with β-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, the probability of bronchial obstruction in COPD patients is lower; however, drugs of this pharmaceutical group have not been compared with cardioselective beta-blockers. For safety reasons, the beta-blocker treatment should be started outside exacerbation of COPD and from a small dose. Careful monitoring is recommended for possible new symptoms, such as emergence / increase of shortness of breath, cough or changes in dosing of other drugs (for example, increased frequency of using short-acting bronchodilators)."
36041937,"Introduction: The goal of the present study is to assess the relationship between functional respiratory parameters measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT) in COPD patients and (1) dyspnea; (2) inspiratory capacity (IC), along with the variations occurring subsequent to bronchodilation.

33781322,"Background: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, acute and potentially fatal skin condition usually induced by drugs. Although much attention is focused on the life threatening acute cutaneous and sight threatening ocular manifestations of this disease, chronic pulmonary complications like bronchiolitis obliterans are occasionally encountered. However, little is known about its incidence, pathogenesis, clinical course and outcome in children recovering from TEN. (1) We report a series of children with TEN and describe the clinical course and outcome of these patients."
36509409,"Background: Home reactions requiring epinephrine administration, a marker of their severity, restrict the widespread use of oral immunotherapy (OIT), but their risk factors are largely not known. (1) Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent OIT at our center between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. (2) Results: Of the 534 patients who underwent OIT, we identified a total of 22 patients (4.1%) who had a home reaction requiring epinephrine administration."
32719055,"Background: An as-needed combination preventer and reliever regimen was recently introduced as an alternative to conventional daily preventer treatment for mild asthma. In a subgroup analysis of the PRACTICAL study, a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of budesonide-formoterol reliever therapy versus maintenance budesonide plus terbutaline reliever therapy in adults with mild asthma, we recently reported that about two-thirds preferred as-needed combination preventer and reliever therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of attributes associated with these two asthma therapies in this subgroup of participants who indicated their preferred treatment in the PRACTICAL study."
31753841,"Background: Although electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were initially marketed as a potential smoking-cessation aid and a safer alternative to smoking, the long-term health effect of e-cigarette use (""vaping"") is unknown. Vaping e-liquids expose the user to several potentially harmful chemicals, including diacetyl, a flavouring compound known to cause bronchiolitis obliterans with inhalational exposure (""popcorn worker's lung"")."
36894266,"A 52-year-old White man, who currently smokes, was admitted to the medical ICU with worsening shortness of breath. The patient was dyspneic for a month and had been clinically diagnosed with COPD by his primary care doctor and started on bronchodilators and supplemental oxygen. He had no known medical history or recent illness. His dyspnea worsened rapidly over the next month, prompting admission to the medical ICU. He was on high-flow oxygen followed by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and then mechanical ventilation. He denied cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss at the time of admission. There was no history of work-related or occupational exposures, drug intake, or recent travel. Review of systems was negative for arthralgia, myalgia, or skin rash."
33371055,Rationale: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Smoking is major risk factor for initial and subsequent lung cancer especially in active smokers. Treatment of subsequent lung cancer depends on whether it is synchronous or metachronous. We report a rare case of triple metachronous lung cancer and review of literature of patients with triple metachronous cancers. This will be the second case reported of triple metachronous lung cancer. (1) We also review the literature of patients with triple metachronous lung cancer.
33901786,"Objective: Evidence of the efficacy of single-inhaler triple therapy in COPD patients inferred from RCTs has not been assessed in a real-world setting in Austria. In this non-interventional study (NIS) tolerability and effectiveness of extrafine beclometasone-dipropionate, formoterol-fumarate and glycopyrronium (Trimbow ® 87 / 5 / 9 μg) was evaluated in COPD patients. (1) Methods: Data from the NIS were used to assess the effectiveness of Trimbow ® 87 / 5 / 9 μg in COPD patients."
34465321,Background: There are various reasons for delayed positive nasopharyngeal PCR tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) in not only asymptomatic but also severely diseased patients. The pathophysiological attributes are not known. We explore this possibility through a case report. (1) Methods: We report a case of a patient with severe COVID19 pneumonia who was initially diagnosed with influenza A pneumonia and later diagnosed with COVID19 pneumonia. (2) Results: The patient was treated with oseltamivir and recovered without any complications.
37179811,"A spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a tear that forms in a blood vessel in the heart without any obvious underlying etiology. It could be a single vessel or multiple vessels. We present a 48-year-old male known to be a heavy smoker without any chronic diseases or family history of heart disease who presents to the cardiology outpatient clinic with shortness of breath and chest pain on exertion. Electrocardiography demonstrated ST depression with T wave inversion of anterior leads, while echocardiography of the patient showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and mildly dilated left chambers. Based on his risks for coronary artery disease, his electrocardiography, and echocardiography, the patient was referred for elective coronary angiography to exclude the possibility of coronary artery disease. The angiography was done with the result of multivessel spontaneous coronary artery dissections involving the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and circumflex artery (CX) with a normal dominant right coronary artery (RCA). Due to the multi-vessel involvement of the dissection and the high risk of extension of the dissection, we preferred conservative management, including smoking cessation and heart failure management. The patient is doing well with regular heart failure treatment in cardiology follow-up."
36792160,"Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) refers to respiratory disorders caused by airflow limitation in the larynx, including vocal cord dysfunction, and may sometimes be misdiagnosed as bronchial asthma (BA). Here, we report the case of an 11-year-old boy diagnosed with BA in infancy. He was referred to our Allergy Center and was taking a high dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) due to frequent coughing from the age of 10 years and persistent coughing following COVID-19 infection at the age of 11. However, the patient continued to experience frequent coughing attacks and repeated visits to the emergency department after inhalation of β2-stimulants failed to improve his cough. We admitted him to the allergy center for examinations to assess the BA severity. In the airway hypersensitiveness test, saline inhalation performed prior to methacholine inhalation caused expiratory stridor and respiratory distress in the larynx, which worsened with β2-stimulant inhalation. Based on these results, we ruled out BA and diagnosed ILO. We instructed him on breathing maneuvers, and he was able to respond appropriately when symptoms appeared. We then started reducing his ICS dose."
