30297319,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic disturbance during pregnancy. The prevalence is rising and correlates with the increase in maternal obesity over recent decades. The etiology of GDM is complex, with genetic and environmental factors implicated in mechanistic and epidemiological studies. GDM begets important short- and long-term health risks for the mother, developing fetus, and offspring. This includes the high likelihood of subsequent maternal type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and possible adverse cardiometabolic phenotypes in the offspring. The most clinically and cost-effective methods of screening for GDM remain uncertain. Whilst treatments with lifestyle and pharmacological interventions have demonstrated short-term benefits, the long-term impact for the offspring of intrauterine exposure to antidiabetic medication remains unclear."
29669543,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), yet a significant proportion of the disease burden cannot be accounted for by conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Hypertension occurs in majority of people with T2DM, which is substantially more frequent than would be anticipated based on general population samples. The impact of hypertension is considerably higher in people with diabetes than it is in the general population, suggesting either an increased sensitivity to its effect or a confounding underlying aetiopathogenic mechanism of hypertension associated with CVD within diabetes. In this contribution, we aim to review the changes observed in the vascular tree in people with T2DM compared to the general population, the effects of established anti-diabetes drugs on microvascular outcomes, and explore the hypotheses to account for common causalities of the increased prevalence of CVD and hypertension in people with T2DM."
27219496,Objective: Development of these guidelines is mandated by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees and adheres to published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). (1) The AACE and ACE Board of Trustees have published guidelines for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
32899917,"Background: Although the body of evidence indicates clear benefits of dietary modifications for prevention of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it may be difficult for healthcare providers to recommend which diet interventions or dietary factors are appropriate for patients as there are too many modalities available. Accordingly, we performed an umbrella review to synthesize evidence on diet interventions and dietary factors in prevention of T2DM. (1) Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diet interventions in prevention of T2DM."
33652942,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is to date the most common chronic liver disease in clinical practice and, consequently, a major health problem worldwide. It affects approximately 30% of adults in the general population and up to 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Despite the current knowledge of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of NAFLD, no specific pharmacological therapies are until now approved for this disease and, consequently, general strategies have been proposed to manage it. They include: (a) lifestyle change in order to promote weight loss by diet and physical activity, (b) control of the main cardiometabolic risk factors, (c) correction of all modifiable risk factors leading the development and progression of advanced forms of NAFLD, and (d) prevention of hepatic and extra-hepatic complications. In the last decade, several potential agents have been widely investigated for the treatment of NAFLD and its advanced forms-shedding some light but casting a few shadows. They include some glucose-lowering drugs (such as pioglitazone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors), antioxidants (such as vitamin E), statins or other lipid lowering agents, bile and non-bile acid farnesoid X activated receptor (FXR) agonists, and others. This narrative review discusses in detail the different available approaches with the potential to prevent and treat NAFLD and its advanced forms."
29122390,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most common forms of chronic liver disease worldwide and its prevalence is expected to continue rising. NAFLD has traditionally been considered a consequence of metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the link between NAFLD and MetS components, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is more complex than previously thought. Indeed, the adverse effects of NAFLD extend far beyond the liver, with a large body of clinical evidence now suggesting that NAFLD may precede and / or promote the development of T2DM, HTN and atherosclerosis / CVD. The risk of developing these cardiometabolic diseases parallels the underlying severity of NAFLD. Accumulating evidence suggests that the presence and severity of NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of incident T2DM and HTN. Moreover, long-term prospective studies indicate that the presence and severity of NAFLD independently predicts fatal and nonfatal CVD events. In this review, we critically discuss the rapidly expanding body of clinical evidence that supports the existence of a bi-directional relationship between NAFLD and various components of MetS, particularly T2DM and HTN, as well as the current knowledge regarding a strong association between NAFLD and CVD morbidity and mortality. Finally, we discuss the most updated putative biological mechanisms through which NAFLD may contribute to the development of HTN, T2DM and CVD."
30179134,"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises individual components including central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and hypertension and it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The menopause per se increases the incidence of MetS in aging women. The effect (s) of menopause on individual components of MetS include: i) increasing central obesity with changes in the fat tissue distribution, ii) potential increase in insulin resistance, iii) changes in serum lipid concentrations, which seem to be associated with increasing weight rather than menopause itself, and, iv) an association between menopause and hypertension, although available data are inconclusive. With regard to the consequences of MetS during menopause, there is no consistent data supporting a causal relationship between menopause and CVD. However, concomitant MetS during menopause appears to increase the risk of CVD. Furthermore, despite the data supporting the association between early menopause and increased risk of T2DM, the association between natural menopause itself and risk of T2DM is not evident. However, the presence and the severity of MetS appears to be associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Although the mechanism is not clear, surgical menopause is strongly linked with a higher incidence of MetS. Interestingly, women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased risk of MetS during their reproductive years; however, with menopausal transition, the risk of MetS becomes similar to that of non-PCOS women."
29704920,"Two-thirds of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have arterial hypertension. Hypertension increases the incidence of both micro- and macrovascular complications in these patients, while the co-existence of these two major risk factors leads to a four-fold increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with normotensive non-diabetic controls. The aim of this article is to comprehensively review the literature and present updated information on targets for blood pressure (BP) and on the management of hypertension in patients with T2DM. A BP target of < 140 / 90 mmHg applies to most patients, but individualization is always important. All classes of antihypertensive drugs can be used in the management of hypertension in patients with T2DM, as long as they are effective and safe and after taking co-morbidities into account. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the ideal choice for initial or early treatment of hypertension in patients with T2DM and albuminuria. Combination of two or more drugs seems to be inevitable as most of these patients demonstrate resistant hypertension. The combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs should be avoided. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics might be beneficial, alone or in a fixed-dose combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) constitute an ideal option as a second- or third-line agent. Beta-blockers are not considered as first-line antihypertensive agents, except for those patients with heart failure or previous myocardial infarction. The addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to a triple-drug therapy seems the next ideal step. Gender-specific characteristics regarding BP, T2DM and CVD should be taken into consideration, even if different recommendations do not exist yet."
32529512,"Although consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) has increasingly been linked with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and all-cause mortality, evidence remains conflicted and dose-response meta-analyses of the associations are lacking. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to synthesize the knowledge about their associations and to explore their dose-response relations. We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Open Grey up to September 2019 for prospective cohort studies investigating the associations in adults. Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for the dose-response association. Restricted cubic splines were used to evaluate linear / non-linear relations. We included 39 articles in the meta-analysis. For each 250-mL / d increase in SSB and ASB intake, the risk increased by 12% (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, I2 = 67.7%) and 21% (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.35, I2 = 47.2%) for obesity, 19% (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.13-1.25, I2 = 82.4%) and 15% (RR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26, I2 = 92.6%) for T2DM, 10% (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14, I2 = 58.4%) and 8% (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.10, I2 = 24.3%) for hypertension, and 4% (RR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, I2 = 58.0%) and 6% (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10, I2 = 80.8%) for all-cause mortality. For SSBs, restricted cubic splines showed linear associations with risk of obesity (Pnon-linearity = 0.359), T2DM (Pnon-linearity = 0.706), hypertension (Pnon-linearity = 0.510) and all-cause mortality (Pnon-linearity = 0.259). For ASBs, we found linear associations with risk of obesity (Pnon-linearity = 0.299) and T2DM (Pnon-linearity = 0.847) and non-linear associations with hypertension (Pnon-linearity = 0.019) and all-cause mortality (Pnon-linearity = 0.048). Increased consumption of SSBs and ASBs is associated with risk of obesity, T2DM, hypertension, and all-cause mortality. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously"
20301444,"Clinical characteristics: Alström syndrome is characterized by cone-rod dystrophy, obesity, progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment, acute infantile-onset cardiomyopathy and / or adolescent- or adult-onset restrictive cardiomyopathy, insulin resistance / type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and chronic progressive kidney disease. Cone-rod dystrophy presents as progressive visual impairment, photophobia, and nystagmus usually starting between birth and age 15 months. Many individuals lose all perception of light by the end of the second decade, but a minority retain the ability to read large print into the third decade. Children usually have normal birth weight but develop truncal obesity during their first year. Sensorineural hearing loss presents in the first decade in as many as 70% of individuals and may progress to the severe or moderately severe range (40-70 db) by the end of the first to second decade. Insulin resistance is typically accompanied by the skin changes of acanthosis nigricans, and proceeds to T2DM in the majority by the third decade. Nearly all demonstrate hypertriglyceridemia."
