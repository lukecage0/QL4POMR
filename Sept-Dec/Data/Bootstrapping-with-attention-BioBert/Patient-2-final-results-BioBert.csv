The main goal of this study was to compare the maximum values of enzymes and CRP in patients with RVMI and LVMI who had first STEMI and who were in the acute phase treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).","65 - year - old woman arrives to the of chest her medical history includes h ##yper ##tens ##ion , ##her ##os ##cle ##rosis , co ##rona ##ry artery disease she a co ##rona ##ry artery bypass g ##raft ( cab ) 3 weeks ago for three vessel disease . reports that her ##ns with inspiration less ##ens when leaning forward a friction heard on au ##s ##cu ##lta ##tion . ##c ##g shows global s ##t","Is this patient history- 65 - year - old woman arrives to the of chest her medical history includes h ##yper ##tens ##ion , ##her ##os ##cle ##rosis , co ##rona ##ry artery disease she a co ##rona ##ry artery bypass g ##raft ( cab ) 3 weeks ago for three vessel disease . reports that her ##ns with inspiration less ##ens when leaning forward a friction heard on au ##s ##cu ##lta ##tion . ##c ##g shows global s ##t- related to abstract- Introduction/aim: Patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI) and patients with left ventricular myocardial infarction (LVMI) of the anterior wall with ST-elevation (STEMI), due to the profundity and volume of the necrosis, tend to have a more severe and more complicated clinical outcome as well as a higher mortality level compared to patients with myocardial infarction of inferoposterior localization in the left ventricle (IPILK), without the right ventricle being overtaken.
