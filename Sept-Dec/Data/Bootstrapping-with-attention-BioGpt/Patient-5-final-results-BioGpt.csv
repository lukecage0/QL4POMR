1,32358144,yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32358144,32358144,"Vocal fold paralysis (VFP) is an important cause of respiratory and feeding compromise in infants. The causes of neonatal VFP are varied and include central nervous system disorders, birth-related trauma, mediastinal masses, iatrogenic injuries, and idiopathic cases. Bilateral VFP often presents with stridor or respiratory distress and can require rapid intervention to stabilize an adequate airway. Unilateral VFP presents more subtly with a weak cry, swallowing dysfunction, and less frequently respiratory distress. The etiology and type of VFP is important for management. Evaluation involves direct visualization of the vocal folds, with additional imaging and testing in select cases. Swallowing dysfunction, also known as dysphagia, is very common in infants with VFP. A clinical assessment of swallowing function is necessary in all cases of VFP, with some patients also requiring an instrumental swallow assessment. Modification of feeding techniques and enteral access for feedings may be necessary. Airway management can vary from close monitoring to noninvasive ventilation, tracheostomy, and laryngeal surgery. Long-term follow-up with otolaryngology and speech-language pathology service is necessary for all children with VFP to ensure adequate breathing, swallowing, and phonation. The short- and long-term health and quality-of-life consequences of VFP can be substantial, especially if not managed early.","A 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy is brought to the ED by his parents for difficulty breathing .

Methods: Clinical data of 109 patients with severe PARDS supported by ECMO, who were hospitalized in 6 ECMO centers in China from September 2012 to February 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into survival group and death group according to the prognosis. Chi-square test and rank sum test were used to compare the variables between the two groups, including the demographic data, laboratory examination results, clinical data before and after ECMO, and other supportive treatment. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression models were used to analyze the prognostic risk factors. Results: In these 109 cases, 54 died and 55 survived. Compared with the survival group, the death group had higher incidences of acute kidney injury (AKI) (48.1% (26 / 54) vs. 21.8% (12 / 55), χ ² = 8.318, P = 0.004) and coagulation dysfunction (22.2% (12 / 54) vs. 7.3% (4 / 55), χ ² = 4.862, P = 0.027), and higher rate of renal replacement therapy (48.1% (26 / 54) vs. 21.8% (12 / 55), χ ² = 9.694, P = 0.008) during ECMO support. Logistic regression analysis showed that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and AKI were independent risk factors for death in patients with severe PARDS requiring ECMO support (HR = 3.88,95% CI 1.04-14.52, HR = 4.84,95% CI 1.21-19.46, both P < 0.05).
