Prenatal diagnosis is highly feasible, allowing proper delivery planning and postnatal management. The clinical presentation is highly variable depending on the anatomical variation; however, most commonly presenting with mild cyanosis and significant tachypnea, although these patients can often go undetected in the immediate newborn period. Transthoracic echocardiography is adequate for diagnosis and detailed anatomical delineation in the majority. Additional imaging modalities such as cardiac catheterization, computed tomography angiography, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in those with more complex pulmonary artery (PA) or aortic anatomy, or in the older repaired. The surgical management of CAT is complete repair in the neonatal period with resection of branch PAs from the CAT with placement of a right ventricular (RV) -to-PA conduit and patch closure of the ventricular septal defect. Overall surgical outcomes are excellent in most centers, with the expectation that the child will eventually outgrow the RV-to-PA conduit and require reoperation. Other potential reoperations or postsurgical interventions in addition to the RV-to-PA conduit may involve the truncal valve or branch PAs.","A 2 @-@ week @-@ old infant delivered at 35 weeks gestation is brought to the pediatr ician by his mother who reports that he has had a harsh , bar cough and makes a high @-@ pit wh sound when he inhal .

4,36945291,yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36945291,36945291,"Ebstein's anomaly is a congenital heart defect characterized by the displacement of the tricuspid valve, and its leaflets to be malformed. Due to the defect involving the tricuspid valve, there is a reverse flow of blood into the right-sided atrium, which may lead to cardiac hypertrophy and edema of the lower extremities. There is a decreased flow of blood out of the right heart due to reduced right ventricular contractility and tricuspid regurgitation. Children afflicted with this anomaly usually suffer from atrial septal defect and this is usually diagnosed before birth on a routine ultrasound scan. In neonates, cyanosis can be seen due to right-to-left atrial shunting or as a result of severe congestive heart failure. If the infant has pulmonary hypertension, cyanosis is markedly increased as there will be a limitation in pulmonary blood flow. In adults, arrhythmias, cyanosis, and heart failure are seen. The bundle of Kent leads to the formation of an electrical conduction abnormality between the right ventricle and atrium. This leads to a condition commonly known as Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome in patients. An enlarged spherical heart is usually present on a chest X-ray. ECG changes of Ebstein's anomaly show taller than usual P waves, PR prolongation, and right bundle branch block. There can be certain neurological and extracardiac manifestations too such as hemiplegia, stroke, dysarthria, etc. During fetal life, specifically at 16 and 20 weeks of gestation, the anomaly can be diagnosed via echocardiography. Prostaglandin infusion (PGE1) is given to maintain pulmonary circulation in neonates if cyanosis is seen. In children and adults with congestive cardiac failure due to this anomaly, medical management includes digoxin, beta-blockers, diuretics, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve heart failure. Surgical treatment includes valve reconstruction. In this article, we review the pathophysiology, genetics, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of Ebstein's Anomaly along with a comprehensive discussion on its genetics, neurological manifestations, extracardiac features, and current advancements in treatment.","A 2 @-@ week @-@ old infant delivered at 35 weeks gestation is brought to the pediatr ician by his mother who reports that he has had a harsh , bar cough and makes a high @-@ pit wh sound when he inhal .
