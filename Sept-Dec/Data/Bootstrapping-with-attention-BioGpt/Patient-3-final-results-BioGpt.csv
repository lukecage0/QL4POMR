1,31462521,yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31462521,31462521,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation is the most common dysrhythmia to occur after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It develops in 10% to 40% of patients and can lead to complications such as hemodynamic instability, heart failure, and stroke. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity. Patients who experience postoperative atrial fibrillation often have longer hospital stays, are at higher risk for readmission, and have increased mortality. Protocols designed to reduce the incidence of the condition can decrease hospital costs, improve patient outcomes, and increase overall quality of care. This quality improvement project took place in a tertiary care center located in southeastern Michigan and focused on the development and implementation of an evidence-based postoperative atrial fibrillation prophylaxis protocol using amiodarone. The outcomes of this project suggest that amiodarone prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients with no previous history of atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.","A 63 @-@ year @-@ old woman with diabetes is recovering in the ICU after receiving a CABG for coronary artery disease .

9,33622099,yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33622099,33622099,"Objectives. Mediastinal chest tubes are considered to be a significant factor causing postoperative pain after cardiac surgery. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether the duration of mediastinal drainage is associated with postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Design. A total of 468 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the Tampere University Hospital between December 2015 and August 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The first 252 patients were treated according to short and the following 216 patients according to extended drainage protocol, in which the mediastinal chest tubes were habitually removed on the first and second postoperative day, respectively. The oxycodone hydrochloride consumption, as well as daily mean pain scores assessed by numeric / visual rating scales, were compared between the groups. Results. The mean daily pain scores and cumulative opioid consumption were similar in both groups. Patients with reduced ejection fraction, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease reported lower initial pain scores. The median cumulative oxycodone hydrochloride consumption did not differ according to the drainage protocol but was higher in males, smokers, and after aortic surgery. In contrast, patients with advanced age, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease had lower consumption. In multivariable analysis, male sex and aortic surgery were associated with higher and advanced age with lower opioid use. Conclusions. The length of mediastinal chest tube drainage is not associated with the amount of postoperative pain or need for opioids after cardiac surgery. Male sex and aortic surgery were associated with higher and advanced age with lower overall opioid consumption.","A 63 @-@ year @-@ old woman with diabetes is recovering in the ICU after receiving a CABG for coronary artery disease .
