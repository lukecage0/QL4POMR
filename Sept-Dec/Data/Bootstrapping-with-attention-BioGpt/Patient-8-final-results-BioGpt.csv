1,33762733,yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33762733,33762733,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can have viral or non-viral causes1-5. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need6,7. Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8 + PD1 + T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8 + PD1 + T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8 + PD1 + CXCR6 +, TOX +, and TNF + T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8 + T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8 + T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment.","A 45 @-@ year @-@ old alcoholic male presents with f and right @-@ hand pain .

Liver cirrhosis demographic data, etiology, severity classification, incidence of complications, diagnosis and prognosis were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Results: Among all liver cirrhosis cases, there were 291 males and 209 females, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4: 1 and an age of 59.5 ± 12.9 years as at August 2017 to December 2018. HBV infection, alcoholic liver disease, and autoimmune liver diseases were the most common etiology of liver cirrhosis. HBV infection alone, HBV infection combined with other factors, alcoholic liver disease alone, alcoholic liver disease combined with other factors, autoimmune liver disease alone, and autoimmune liver disease combined with other factors were presented in 163 (32.6%), 57 (11.4%), 47 (9.4%), 63 (12.6%), 85 (17.0%), and 22 (4.4.0%) cases, respectively.

The most common site of infection was the abdominal cavity (20 cases), accounting for 54.1%; followed by respiratory tract infection (8 cases), accounting for 21.6% in patients with liver cirrhosis with concurrent infection. Among them, there were 32 cases of bacterial infection alone, one case of bacterial infection combined with fungal infection, one case of bacterial infection combined with viral infection, and three cases of unknown pathogens. There were 69 cases in Child Pugh grade C, and the average hospitalization times were 12.6 days in terms of prognosis. There were total seven cases of death, of which five cases were due to upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and two due to hepatic encephalopathy.

Newly, remarkable attention has been paid to a natural diet with the capability to scavenge ROS. Withania coagulans root extract (WCE) is rich in components with antioxidants properties. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of WCE on cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) against OS-mediated apoptosis after I / R injury. In this experimental study 64 male adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 16) as follows: control, sham, I / R, and WCE 1000 + I / R. I / R animals were pretreated with daily administration of hydro-alcoholic WCE (1000 mg / kg) or distilled water as a vehicle for 30 days before I / R injury. After 72 h, the animals were sacrificed, the cerebellum tissue was removed and used for biochemical (CAT, SOD, GPx, and MDA levels) and histopathological (Nissl and TUNEL staining) assays. Findings showed that the MDA level and the number of apoptotic neurons significantly increased and viable Purkinje neurons decreased in I / R injury (p < 0.05). Administration of 1000 mg / kg WCE reduced MDA level and enhanced antioxidants activity including CAT, SOD, and GPx significantly. In addition, intact surviving PCs increased. At the same time, TUNEL-positive neurons decreased significantly in the WCE pre-treated group (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that WCE can counteract cerebral I / R-induced OS and associated neuronal death by enhancement of ROS scavenging and antioxidant capacity. It appears that pre-treatment with 1000 mg / kg WCE for thirty days can protect PCs against OS-mediated apoptosis after I / R injury.","A 45 @-@ year @-@ old alcoholic male presents with f and right @-@ hand pain .

After 72 h, the animals were sacrificed, the cerebellum tissue was removed and used for biochemical (CAT, SOD, GPx, and MDA levels) and histopathological (Nissl and TUNEL staining) assays. Findings showed that the MDA level and the number of apoptotic neurons significantly increased and viable Purkinje neurons decreased in I / R injury (p < 0.05). Administration of 1000 mg / kg WCE reduced MDA level and enhanced antioxidants activity including CAT, SOD, and GPx significantly. In addition, intact surviving PCs increased. At the same time, TUNEL-positive neurons decreased significantly in the WCE pre-treated group (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that WCE can counteract cerebral I / R-induced OS and associated neuronal death by enhancement of ROS scavenging and antioxidant capacity. It appears that pre-treatment with 1000 mg / kg WCE for thirty days can protect PCs against OS-mediated apoptosis after I / R injury."

Chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and a 10-cm pancreatic pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas had been found 5 years previously. He had not stopped drinking alcohol since then. On admission, laboratory tests revealed severe anemia, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed extravasation in the pancreatic pseudocyst. The spleen was retracted by the pancreatic pseudocyst, and its configuration was indistinct. The patient was diagnosed with acute bleeding within the pancreatic pseudocyst and splenic rupture. He was transferred to our university hospital on an emergency basis. Abdominal angiography of the splenic artery was immediately performed, but the bleeding point was not found. Although the bleeding stopped spontaneously, an infection of the pancreatic pseudocyst and a splenic hematoma subsequently developed. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided pseudocyst drainage was performed. The infection improved after the drainage, and the size of the pancreatic pseudocyst and splenic hematoma decreased. Five months later, the pancreatic pseudocyst had almost disappeared, and the splenic hematoma was even smaller. We herein report a rare case of splenic rupture caused by a pancreatic pseudocyst. Although the patient's condition became complicated by severe infection, treatment by endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage was successful.","A 45 @-@ year @-@ old alcoholic male presents with f and right @-@ hand pain .
