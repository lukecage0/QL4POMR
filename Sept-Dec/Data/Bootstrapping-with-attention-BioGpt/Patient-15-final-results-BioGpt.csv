We hypothesized from the results of several previously reported studies, that patients with a minimal aortic injury (BTAI grades 1 and 2) could safely be treated with definitive MM alone.

6,37546026,yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37546026,37546026,"The liver is one of the most commonly injured solid organs in blunt abdominal trauma. In patients who are hemodynamically normal, most cases of blunt liver injuries are managed conservatively. At present, nonoperative management (noM) is the standard of care for both minor and severe liver injuries. Usually, patients with severe liver injuries, i.e., grades IV and V, are treated with surgical intervention versus angioembolization depending if patients are hemodynamically stable or not. We present a hemodynamically stable 53-year-old male patient with a grade V blunt liver injury with complete avulsion of the left lobe of the liver after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). Very few cases of complete hepatic avulsions have been published in the literature. We discuss surgical management with stapler-assisted hepatectomy in emergency trauma laparotomy for bleeding control.","A 30 @-@ year @-@ old un driver is brought in by parame after a high @-@ speed MVC .
