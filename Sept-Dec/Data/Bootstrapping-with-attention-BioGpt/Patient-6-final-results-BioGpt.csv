Rising trends in obesity and metabolic syndrome have contributed to an increase in diagnosis of cholelithiasis. There are several risk factors for cholelithiasis, both modifiable and nonmodifiable. Women are more likely to experience cholelithiasis than are men. Pregnancy, increasing parity, and obesity during pregnancy further increase the risk that a woman will develop cholelithiasis. The classic presentation of persons experiencing cholelithiasis, specifically when gallstones obstruct the common bile duct, is right upper quadrant pain of the abdomen that is often elicited upon palpation during physical examination and documented as a positive Murphy's sign. Referred pain to the right supraclavicular region and / or shoulder, nausea, and vomiting are also frequently reported by persons with cholelithiasis. Cholelithiasis can result in complications, including cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) and cholangitis (inflammation of the bile duct). Lack of physical examination findings does not rule out a diagnosis of cholelithiasis. Laboratory tests such as white blood cell count, liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase may assist the clinician in diagnosing cholelithiasis; however, ultrasonography is the gold standard for diagnosis. Management is dependent on severity and frequency of symptoms. Lifestyle and dietary modifications combined with medication management, such as use of gallstone dissolution agents, may be recommended for persons who have a single symptomatic episode.

Her history and clinical findings were suggestive of two rare and complex disorders, hereditary angioedema (HAE) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Her recurrent episodes of abdominal and joint pain were initially misattributed to more common diagnoses such as esophagitis, depression and chronic pain syndrome. However, the coexistence of HAE and EDS likely contributed to a delay in diagnoses as the combination of these two rare but overlapping disorders is less understood by physicians. She had persistently low levels of C4 and C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) with low to low-normal C1-esterase function, normal C1Q and no C1Q antibodies. In the setting of recurrent abdominal pain with cutaneous swelling, this supported the diagnosis of HAE type I. The increase in joint extensibility with recurrent shoulder subluxations since childhood was a manifestation of EDS.

Prior to presentation, her general practitioner had started her on a reducing steroid dose for suspected Crohn's disease exacerbation. On examination, she had a distended abdomen with localised guarding and tenderness over her hernia site. A CT scan demonstrated an incarcerated perforated gallbladder within her parastomal hernia. Successful surgical management was performed involving an enterotomy, refashioning her ileostomy and an open cholecystectomy. The patient recovered well with a short postoperative stay. This report is intended as a guide for clinicians in the differential diagnoses for acute abdominal pain and an unusual presentation of a gallbladder perforation."
