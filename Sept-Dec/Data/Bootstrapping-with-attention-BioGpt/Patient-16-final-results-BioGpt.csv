Pelvic nonunion and associated stress fractures are under-reported. Nonunited stress fractures can cause continued buttock pain and pelvic instability. The aim of this study is to report on our experience managing patients with ongoing pain following nonunion of PAO. (1) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who underwent PAO for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia between January 2010 and December 2015.,"A 62 @-@ year @-@ old male presents to the physician with pain in his but that comes on during his evening wal with his wife , forcing him to stop and rest .

13,37362469,maybe,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37362469,37362469,"In this study, we discuss a case of a 59-year-old male who developed a periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) three months after a total hip arthroplasty (THA). The patient complained of groin and buttock pain, swelling, and high temperature. A palpable fluid collection, discomfort, edema, and elevated local temperature were present in the clinical examination. Laboratory analysis revealed elevated white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The preoperative joint aspiration came up positive for Staphylococcus caprae (S. caprae) infection. Diagnosis and pathogen identification were confirmed by histological examination of six tissue samples obtained during surgery. We initially performed early debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) followed by antibiotic therapy suggested by an infectious disease specialist. DAIR failed two months later, and we proceeded to a two-stage revision. Following surgery, the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotic combination therapy for three weeks and thereafter with oral antibiotics for three months. Four months down the line, the patient is free of symptoms, and the inflammatory markers are normal. Finally, we will proceed with the second stage of revision. This study highlights a very rare case of PJI infection by S. caprae, reviews the limited literature, and provides the available evidence for surgical and antibiotic management.","A 62 @-@ year @-@ old male presents to the physician with pain in his but that comes on during his evening wal with his wife , forcing him to stop and rest .
