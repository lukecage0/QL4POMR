5,31080117,maybe,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31080117,31080117,"Retrorectal tumors (RRT), whether benign or malignant in nature, are rare in adults and often asymptomatic. While diagnosis is based on clinical findings, differential diagnosis depends mainly on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI provides guidance for surgical management, the first-line treatment of choice. Four surgical approaches are described: abdominal, perineal, posterior and abdomino-sacral.. This review of major reported series has made it possible to specify the indications for each surgical approach, as well as the advantages, disadvantages and complications of each one. The choice of surgical approach is determined by the nature of the RRT, its anatomical position relative to the middle of the third sacral vertebra (S3) and the presence or absence of invasion of the neighboring organs, the pelvis or sacral vertebrae. The abdominal route is chosen for tumors situated above the middle of S3, whether benign or malignant, but without invasion of neighboring organs. The perineal route is indicated for benign RRT situated below the middle of S3. The posterior route is chosen for tumors located below the middle of S3, and allows an associated resection of sacral segments in case of tumor invasion. The combined abdomino-sacral route is indicated for RRT above the middle of S3, when there is an invasion of a pelvic organ or a sacral vertebra. Intra- and post-operative complications are mainly hemorrhagic, neurological and infectious. The long-term prognosis is usually favorable, but varies according to the nature of the RRT and its management.","A 50 @-@ year @-@ old field worker arri ves to a free clinic to discuss a “ sore ” on his lower lip .

The incidence in adults increases with age, being seen most commonly in men in their 50s and 60s, so the presence of other medical conditions or infections can make it more difficult to identify spondylodiscitis. Diagnosis is made based on clinical suspicion, raised levels of inflammatory markers, a positive blood or tissue biopsy culture and radiological findings. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, treatment must be started promptly. The mainstay of treatment is medical management, with antibiotics tailored to the relevant organism, as well as immobilisation. Where surgery is indicated, the aims are debridement of infected tissue, tissue sampling, neural decompression and stabilisation. Spondylodiscitis is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity and should be treated promptly to ensure the best outcome.","A 50 @-@ year @-@ old field worker arri ves to a free clinic to discuss a “ sore ” on his lower lip .
