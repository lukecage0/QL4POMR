This excessive bacterial biomass, in turn, disrupts host physiology in a myriad of ways, leading to gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms and complications. SIBO is a common cause of non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms in children, such as chronic abdominal pain, abdominal distention, diarrhoea, and flatulence, amongst others. In addition, it has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of stunting, a disease that affects millions of children worldwide. Risk factors such as acid-suppressive therapies, alterations in gastrointestinal motility and anatomy, as well as impoverished conditions, have been shown to predispose children to SIBO. SIBO can be diagnosed via culture-dependant or culture-independent approaches. SIBO's epidemiology is limited due to the lack of uniformity and consensus of its diagnostic criteria, as well as the paucity of literature available. Antibiotics remain the first-line treatment option for SIBO, although emerging modalities such as probiotics and diet manipulation could also have a role.

Despite reduction in mortality associated with extreme prematurity, long term pulmonary morbidities remain a concern, with growing recognition of the clinical burden attributable to infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) -associated pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recent publications shed light on the critical contributions of maternal placental pathology and compromised intrauterine growth to fetal pulmonary vascular development.

Limitations of current diagnostics persist with growing consideration of novel echocardiographic approaches as well as complementary non-invasive biomarkers to better identify infants at risk. In 2015, a joint report published by the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society provided the first guidelines for the care of children with PH with limited content to address BPD-associated PH.

The purpose of this review was to summarize evidence from systematic reviews of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) regarding antenatal and postnatal interventions for preventing NEC. PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library Databases, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Campbell Library were searched for meta-analyses in which NEC was reported as an outcome after antenatal or postnatal strategies. The AMSTAR instrument was used to evaluate quality of included reviews. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessment was used to evaluate certainty of evidence. We identified 98 meta-analyses of RCTs. The quality of included reviews was adequate, whereas the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low. Moderate certainty evidence showed a reduction in NEC following administration of a combination of species of probiotics, probiotics (any), antenatal corticosteroids in pregnant women at risk of preterm birth, and ibuprofen versus indomethacin for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). For surgical NEC, moderate certainty evidence showed an increased risk with lower (85-89%) oxygen saturation target levels, compared with higher (91-95%) oxygen saturation target levels. In conclusion, decreased risk of NEC is observed with probiotics, antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth, and ibuprofen versus indomethacin for treatment of PDA.
