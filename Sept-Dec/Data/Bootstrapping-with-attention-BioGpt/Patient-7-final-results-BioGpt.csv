Further study is necessary to better diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients. CASE REPORT We describe the case of an 8-year-old boy admitted with status epilepticus, who also tested positive for COVID-19, while afebrile, with no initial respiratory symptoms. Benzodiazepines were given per treatment guidelines, abating the seizure activity. He subsequently developed respiratory distress and desaturation requiring temporary emergent intubation. All clinical symptoms resolved within a few hours. Results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain were within normal limits. Results of a 24-h electroencephalogram (EEG) were abnormal, indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction. As a result of intubation and findings of bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, a COVID-19 test was administered and the result was positive. CONCLUSIONS For proper diagnosis and treatment, patients and clinicians should be aware that COVID-19 may not present in the typical fashion of respiratory distress and fever.

However, immunocompromised and unvaccinated patients are still at grave risk. Case: A 58-year-old African American male who used alcohol and intravenous (IV) drugs presented with confusion, fever, and hemoptysis. He had coarse rhonchi with a grade 2 / 5 holosystolic apical murmur. CT chest showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Blood cultures were positive for pansensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. Echocardiogram demonstrated large vegetations on the anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve with flail leaflet and severe eccentric mitral regurgitation. Patient was started on IV ceftriaxone, but after 3 weeks of therapy, he wished to leave against medical advice. He was discharged on combination oral therapy with successful resolution of SPE on follow-up. Discussion: Invasive pneumococcus is highly virulent causing irreversible valvular destruction or death. IV beta-lactams are first-line treatment, but there are currently no guideline-recommended alternatives for oral therapy. Recent data suggest partial oral therapy may be noninferior to IV only therapy.

We conducted a multicenter one arm proof of concept interventional study. Patients with Covid-19 disease with moderate-to-severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, elevated C-reactive Protein and need for mechanical ventilation and / or CPAP were enrolled. One to three 250-300 ml unit of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibodies titer ≥ 1: 160) were administered. Primary outcome was 7-days hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were PaO2 / FiO2, laboratory and radiologic changes, as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety. The study observed 46 patients from March, 25 to April, 21 2020. Patients were aged 63, 61% male, of them, 30 were on CPAP and 7 intubated. PaO2 / FiO2 was 128 (SD 47). Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray was present in 36 patients (84%). Symptoms and ARDS duration were 14 (SD 7) and 6 days (SD 3). Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days as compared to an expected 15% from the National Statistics and 30% from a small concurrent cohort of 23 patients. The upper one-sided 90% CI was 13.9%, allowing to reject the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. PaO2 / FiO2 increased by 112 units (95% CI 82 to142) in survivors, the chest radiogram severity decreased in 23% (95% CI 5% to 42%); CRP, Ferritin and LDH decreased by 60, 36 and 20% respectively.

Our case had a fulminant course, with three rare, near-fatal complications and was successfully managed conservatively. Pleural effusion due to pleuro-pancreatic fistula is uncommon, seen in only 1% cases, of which right-sided effusions are rarer still. Management modalities include conservative, endoscopic, and surgical options. Chylous ascites is an extremely rare complication of pancreatitis and is managed with high protein, low lipid diet, restricted to medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Extra-splanchnic venous thrombosis is uncommon in pancreatitis, and isolated renal vein thrombosis is very rare. Case Presentation A 34-year-old, chronic alcoholic male, presented to the outpatient department (OPD) in a state of shock and respiratory distress. Chest radiograph showed massive right-sided pleural effusion. The pleural fluid was hemorrhagic with markedly elevated amylase levels, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) confirmed the presence of a right-sided pleuro-pancreatic fistula.

But concurrent infections pose a diagnostic challenge owing to similar clinical features. Data suggests a high prevalence of such concurrent infections in developing countries but limited diagnostic modalities especially in resource constraint setup limits accurate diagnosis. At our centre we came across 6 newly diagnosed PTB patients among HIV infected ones had persistent shortness of breath (SOB) and hypoxia despite starting anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT). We excluded concomitant bacterial pneumonia by imaging, sputum examination and blood culture. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was estimated and hypoxia by arterial blood gas (ABG). We found all 6 patients had elevated serum LDH, hypoxia and imaging suggestive of PJP were offered sputum for Geisma stain and standard treatment for PJP in form of Bactrim-double strength and steroid. 1 patient had PJ cysts in sputum. 5 patient's classical radiologic findings in form of ground glass opacities in lower lobes along with bilateral infiltrates and 1 had honeycombing. Serum LDH was elevated all 6 subjects. 5 were newly diagnosed HIV and 4 had CD4 count below 50 cells / mm3 and 2 had below 200 cells / mm3.1 patient had developed bilateral pneumothorax as complication. 4 patients responded to treatment and 2 (33.3%) died of respiratory failure during treatment. We were able to diagnose only severe PJP cases as concurrent infection with PTB as there was no availability of broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) as well as direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) test for PJ detection. A high index of suspicion for PJP even in PTB patients with low CD4 count will guide to appropriate therapy for both infections and eventually reduces morbidity and mortality.","A 41 @-@ year @-@ old man with alcoholism is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis .

But concurrent infections pose a diagnostic challenge owing to similar clinical features. Data suggests a high prevalence of such concurrent infections in developing countries but limited diagnostic modalities especially in resource constraint setup limits accurate diagnosis. At our centre we came across 6 newly diagnosed PTB patients among HIV infected ones had persistent shortness of breath (SOB) and hypoxia despite starting anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT). We excluded concomitant bacterial pneumonia by imaging, sputum examination and blood culture. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was estimated and hypoxia by arterial blood gas (ABG). We found all 6 patients had elevated serum LDH, hypoxia and imaging suggestive of PJP were offered sputum for Geisma stain and standard treatment for PJP in form of Bactrim-double strength and steroid. 1 patient had PJ cysts in sputum. 5 patient's classical radiologic findings in form of ground glass opacities in lower lobes along with bilateral infiltrates and 1 had honeycombing. Serum LDH was elevated all 6 subjects. 5 were newly diagnosed HIV and 4 had CD4 count below 50 cells / mm3 and 2 had below 200 cells / mm3.1 patient had developed bilateral pneumothorax as complication. 4 patients responded to treatment and 2 (33.3%) died of respiratory failure during treatment. We were able to diagnose only severe PJP cases as concurrent infection with PTB as there was no availability of broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) as well as direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) test for PJ detection. A high index of suspicion for PJP even in PTB patients with low CD4 count will guide to appropriate therapy for both infections and eventually reduces morbidity and mortality."

The demographic data, clinical manifestations, and laboratory and radiological findings of 527 pSS patients were retrospectively analyzed. ILD was defined based on the presences of pulmonary signs in HRCT. Two hundred six of 527 patients were diagnosed as pSS-ILD, and the prevalence was 39.1%. The three most frequent abnormalities in HRCT were reticular pattern (92.7%), ground-glass attenuation (87.4%), and bronchovascular bundle thickening (82%). One hundred twenty-four cases (60.2%) of the pSS-ILD patients had only a single HRCT pattern, which involved 86 non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) cases (41.7%), 22 usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) cases (10.68%), 8 organizing pneumonia (OP) cases (3.9%), and 8 lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) cases (3.9%), respectively. Besides, the more important observation was that 82 cases had no less than two HRCT patterns, and NSIP admixed with OP (43.9%), NSIP admixed with UIP (35.4%), and NSIP admixed with LIP (19.5%) were the most frequent. HRCT of pSS-ILD patients demonstrated bilateral infiltrates (99%), with abnormalities predominantly in the lower lobes (89.3%) and subpleural areas (81.1%), and a few lesions were characterized by hilum distributed (8.7%). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) revealed impaired diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and total lung capacity, and the rate of small airway lesions in the pSS-ILD patients was 3.5 times higher in patients of pSS. Logistic regression analysis showed that dry cough (OR 59.05), clubbing (OR 6.26), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (OR 21.38) and positive anti-Ro (OR 7.86) were relevant factors of pSS-ILD. ILD is the common pulmonary involvement of pSS and the prevalence of pSS-ILD is 39.1%. The single pattern of NSIP and UIP in HRCT are the commonest, and about 40% of the pSS-ILD patients possess multiple patterns in HRCT. The classification of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis cannot completely include the pulmonary imaging features of pSS-ILD.","A 41 @-@ year @-@ old man with alcoholism is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis .
