5,31165193,yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31165193,31165193,"We report a case of a 16-year-old boy who presented a soft-tissue mass in the anterior compartment of the right thigh discovered by positron emission tomography / computed tomography within the work-up of unexplained prolonged inflammatory syndrome. The mass has no calcification. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging of the femoral triangle was carried out. Axial short tau inversion recovery images showed a 3.5-cm ill-defined mass in the femoral triangle with focal areas of hypointensity, which suggests that there might be fibrosis or hemosiderin within the tumor. Axial T1-weighted images showed a slight hyperintense mass involving the iliopsoas muscle. Contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted imaging showed a heterogeneous solid enhancement. Adjacent thick fascia enhancement of the vastus intermedius and the vastus lateralis muscles extending from the mass as a tail-like margin suggested the infiltrative spread of the tumor along the fascial plane. The mass and the lymphadenopathy were excised. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were staining for muscle actin and desmin. Many plasma cells were IgG4 + (175per high-power field) with a ratio IgG4 + / IgG + of 50%. The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) was made. Although a diffuse array of musculoskeletal symptoms has been observed in IgG4-related disease, reports of biopsy-proven musculoskeletal involvement of the limb are rare. We showed the radiological features of IgG4-RD presenting as a soft-tissue mass of the thigh. Musculoskeletal involvement, clinical significance, and treatment of IgG4-RD are also discussed.","A 17 @-@ year @-@ old male comes to the emergency department for the third time over the last month due to pain in his right thigh above his knee that is particularly bo at night .

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) mostly occurs in adolescents aged 10-15 years and is characterized by more aggressive behaviors and worse prognosis than other sarcomas, prone to lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis in the early stage as well as metastasizing to breast, testis, pancreas, and other parts. ARMS often occurs in the limbs and genitourinary system, however, head and neck ARMS are relatively rare when involving the nasal cavity or sinuses. The role of MRI and 18F-FDG positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET / CT) remains to be established in ARMS.","A 17 @-@ year @-@ old male comes to the emergency department for the third time over the last month due to pain in his right thigh above his knee that is particularly bo at night .
