32155645,"Progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been hampered for many reasons. Included among these is the fact that what we are calling ""NEC"" is likely to represent different disease processes, which need to be delineated before evaluating individual pathogenic mechanisms and attempting to develop predictive and diagnostic biomarkers. Treatment is also likely to be hampered because not all of the different entities called ""NEC"" will respond to the same regimen. In this review, some of these entities will be discussed in more detail, with suggestions for refining our approach toward improving methods for their diagnosis, prevention and treatment."
31810384,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is the leading cause of death due to gastrointestinal disease in preterm neonates, affecting 5 12% of neonates born at a very-low birth weight. Necrotizing enterocolitis can present with a slow and insidious onset, with some neonates displaying early symptoms such as feeding intolerance. Treatment during the early stages includes bowel rest and careful use of antibiotics, but surgery is required if pneumoperitoneum and intestinal perforation occur. Mortality rates among neonates requiring surgery are estimated to be 20 30%, mandating the development of non-invasive and reliable biomarkers to predict necrotizing enterocolitis before the onset of clinical signs. Such biomarkers would allow at-risk neonates to receive maximal preventative therapies such as careful nutritional consideration, probiotics, and increased skin-to-skin care."
31272578,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can involve any aspect of the colon starting with mucosal inflammation in the rectum and extending proximally in a continuous fashion. Typical symptoms on presentation are bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, fecal urgency, and tenesmus. In some patients, extraintestinal manifestations may predate the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. A diagnosis of UC is made on the basis of presenting symptoms consistent with UC as well as endoscopic evidence showing continuous and diffuse colonic inflammation that starts in the rectum. Biopsies of the colon documenting chronic inflammation confirm the diagnosis of UC. Most cases are treated with pharmacological therapy to first induce remission and then to maintain a corticosteroid-free remission. There are multiple classes of drugs used to treat the disease. For mild to moderate UC, oral and rectal 5-aminosalycilates are typically used. In moderate to severe colitis, medication classes include thiopurines, biological agents targeting tumor necrosis factor and integrins, and the small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitors. However, in up to 15% of cases, patients in whom medical therapy fails or who have development of dysplasia secondary to their long-standing colitis will require surgical treatment. Finally, to minimize the complications of UC and adverse events from medications, a working collaboration between primary care physicians and gastroenterologists is necessary to make sure that vaccinations are optimized and that patients are screened for colon cancer, skin cancer, bone loss, depression, and other treatable and preventable complications."
30793842,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an acute inflammatory disease of the intestine which primarily affects preterm infants and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal intensive care unit. From a clinical standpoint, and during the early course of the disease, NEC can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases and conditions common to the preterm infant, and this warrants the need for specific disease biomarkers. The pathogenesis of NEC is only partly understood but likely involves an altered intestinal barrier immune response to feeding and the developing microbiome. Recent evidence points toward a role of the enteric nervous system in NEC pathogenesis. In this issue, Meister and colleagues use a rodent model of NEC to demonstrate that NEC is associated with diminished vagal tone, as determined by decreased high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), and altered myenteric nitrergic inhibitory neurotransmission. These results augment their previous findings that describe decreased HF-HRV in human preterm infants with NEC. This mini-review provides a brief summary of clinical and pathophysiologic aspects of NEC with focus on certain aspects of neurogastroenterology."
30680646,"Bacterial colonization patterns in preterm infants differ from those of their term counterparts due to maternal microbial diversity, delivery mode, feeding methods, antibiotic use, and exposure to commensal microbiota and pathogens in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Early gut microbiome dysbiosis predisposes neonates to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating intestinal disease with high morbidity and mortality. Though mechanisms of NEC pathogenesis are not fully understood, the microbiome is a promising therapy target for prevention and treatment. Direct administration of probiotics to preterm infants has been shown to reduce the incidence of NEC, but is not without risk. The immature immune systems of preterm infants leave them vulnerable to even beneficial bacteria. Further research is required to investigate both short-term and long-term effects of probiotic administration to preterm infants. Other methods of altering the preterm infant microbiome must also be considered, including breastfeeding, prebiotics, and targeting the maternal microbiome."
32085587,"This review aims to discuss the role of nutrition and feeding practices in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), NEC prevention, and its complications, including surgical treatment. A thorough PubMed search was performed with a focus on meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials when available. There are several variables in nutrition and the feeding of preterm infants with the intention of preventing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Starting feeds later rather than earlier, advancing feeds slowly and continuous feeds have not been shown to prevent NEC and breast milk remains the only effective prevention strategy. The lack of medical treatment options for NEC often leads to disease progression requiring surgical resection. Following resection, intestinal adaptation occurs, during which villi lengthen and crypts deepen to increase the functional capacity of remaining bowel. The effect of macronutrients on intestinal adaptation has been extensively studied in animal models. Clinically, the length and portion of intestine that is resected may lead to patients requiring parenteral nutrition, which is also reviewed here. There remain significant gaps in knowledge surrounding many of the nutritional aspects of NEC and more research is needed to determine optimal feeding approaches to prevent NEC, particularly in infants younger than 28 weeks and < 1000 grams. Additional research is also needed to identify biomarkers reflecting intestinal recovery following NEC diagnosis individualize when feedings should be safely resumed for each patient."
30864508,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains the most threatening gastrointestinal complication of prematurity leading to high mortality, morbidity and cost. Common complications of NEC include neurodevelopmental delay, failure to thrive, gastrointestinal problems including strictures and adhesions, cholestasis, short bowel syndrome with or without intestinal failure that can be difficult to manage. Infants who develop NEC benefit from close follow-up for early diagnosis and treatment of complications. Those who present with severe complications such as intestinal failure benefit from a multidisciplinary approach involving careful assessment and treatment. Studies done so far are limited in providing a long-term prognosis. Here we review some of these complications. More studies with a longer follow-up period are needed to better understand the later comorbidities that develop in babies with NEC."
33476530,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating gastrointestinal disease of neonates, especially of preterm infants, with high morbidity and mortality. The surviving infants may have digestive tract and neurological sequelae. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of NEC are of great significance in improving survival rate and survival quality of neonates. To provide evidence-based recommendations for management of NEC, the guidelines were developed based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and the current domestic and overseas studies."
34654968,"Ultrasound has proved to be a useful modality for enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of necrotizing enterocolitis and associated complications. The standard imaging algorithm for evaluating necrotizing enterocolitis includes radiographs and clinical symptoms, the combination of which constitutes the Bell criteria. Major limitations of using the Bell criteria for diagnosing and clinically managing necrotizing enterocolitis include low diagnostic accuracy of radiographs and nonspecific symptomatology of preterm infants. In this regard, US can offer additional insights into bowel health by helping to characterize bowel motility, echogenicity, thickness, pneumatosis and perfusion. Extramural findings such as portal venous gas, nature and extent of ascites, and pneumoperitoneum can also be assessed. Recently, contrast-enhanced US was explored in a case series of preterm bowel disease and its diagnostic utility warrants further investigation. This article reviews the US features of necrotizing enterocolitis and highlights the role of US as a complement to radiographs, as well as the emerging use of contrast-enhanced US in necrotizing enterocolitis."
30974443,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a relatively common disease in very-low-birth-weight infants and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. In survivors, neurodevelopmental impairment is frequently seen. The exact etiology remains largely to be elucidated, but microbiota are considered to play a major role in the development of NEC. Furthermore, emerging evidence exists that the microbiota is also of importance in brain function and development. Therefore, microbiota characterization has not only potential as a diagnostic or even preventive tool to predict NEC, but may also serve as a biomarker to monitor and possibly even as a target to manipulate brain development. Analysis of fecal volatile organic compounds, which shape the volatile metabolome and reflect microbiota function and host interaction, has been shown to be of interest in the diagnosis of NEC and late-onset sepsis. In this review, we discuss evidence of the role of the complex interplay between microbiota, NEC, and brain development, including the brain-gut axis in preterm infants."
34506326,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine which initial surgical treatment results in the lowest rate of death or neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in premature infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or isolated intestinal perforation (IP). (1) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of infants with NEC or IP who underwent surgical treatment at a single institution from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014. (2) Results: Of the 535 infants with NEC or IP, the mortality rate was significantly lower in the infants who underwent primary repair (n = 513) than in those who underwent primary resection (n = 10) (0% vs."
36328610,"The Necrotizing Enterocolitis Surgery Trial (NEST) highlights the importance of distinguishing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) from spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) when developing surgical treatment plans. Further research is needed to increase the accuracy of this distinction, but even with our current abilities to do this initial laparotomy appears to be optimal for infants with presumed NEC. The preferred initial operation for those with SIP is more equivocal. Rates of NEC are likely decreasing slowly, whereas those with SIP are not. New imaging modalities, especially ultrasound, are becoming more useful but require more detailed investigation. Understanding the mechanisms causing these two conditions remains of paramount importance."
31552207,"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a heterogenous and poorly understood entity characterised by an excessive growth of select microorganisms within the small intestine. This excessive bacterial biomass, in turn, disrupts host physiology in a myriad of ways, leading to gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms and complications. SIBO is a common cause of non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms in children, such as chronic abdominal pain, abdominal distention, diarrhoea, and flatulence, amongst others. In addition, it has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of stunting, a disease that affects millions of children worldwide. Risk factors such as acid-suppressive therapies, alterations in gastrointestinal motility and anatomy, as well as impoverished conditions, have been shown to predispose children to SIBO. SIBO can be diagnosed via culture-dependant or culture-independent approaches. SIBO's epidemiology is limited due to the lack of uniformity and consensus of its diagnostic criteria, as well as the paucity of literature available. Antibiotics remain the first-line treatment option for SIBO, although emerging modalities such as probiotics and diet manipulation could also have a role. Herein, we present a state-of-the-art-review which aims to comprehensively outline the most current information on SIBO in children, with particular emphasis on the gut microbiota."
30868956,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an acquired severe disease of the digestive system affecting mostly premature babies, possibly fatal and frequently associated to systemic complications. Because of the severity of this condition and the possible long-term consequences on the child's development, many studies have aimed at preventing the occurrence of the primary events at the level of the bowel wall (ischemia and necrosis followed by sepsis) by modifying or manipulating the diet (breast milk versus formula) and / or the feeding pattern (time for initiation after birth, continuous versus bolus feeding, modulation of intake according clinical events). Feeding have been investigated so far in order to prevent NEC. However, currently well-established and shared clinical nutritional practices are not available in preventing NEC. Nutritional and surgical treatments of NEC are instead well defined. In selected cases surgery is a therapeutic option of NEC, requiring sometimes partial intestinal resection responsible for short bowel syndrome. In this paper we will investigate the available options for treating NEC according to the Walsh and Kliegman classification, focusing on feeding practices in managing short bowel syndrome that can complicate NEC. We will also analyze the proposed ways of preventing NEC."
32855507,"One of the many challenges with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains our inability to make an accurate diagnosis of NEC. The lack of a unifying cause and multiple variations in presentations lead to great uncertainty with NEC. Separating out the needs of the researcher wanting to define NEC from the clinician and patient family's perspectives who want an accurate diagnosis for NEC is important. The need to augment and / or replace the outdated modified Bell staging criteria is crucial to improving NEC management. Emerging literature suggests that genetic susceptibility and stool microbiota signatures may help identify preterm infants at increased risk of the disease. Ongoing studies using single or multi-omic approaches may help to characterize biomarkers that will aid in the prediction or early diagnosis of NEC, as well as differentiate other causes of severe bowel injury. Bowel ultrasound shows promise in improving our diagnostic accuracy for NEC but has been slow in adoption. Patient family perspectives are key in accelerating our efforts to integrate newer diagnostic methods into practice."
33664467,"Anemia of prematurity (AOP) is a common condition with a well-described chronology, nadir hemoglobin levels, and timeline of recovery. However, the underlying pathophysiology and impact of prolonged exposure of the developing infant to low levels of hemoglobin remains unclear. Phlebotomy losses exacerbate the gradual decline of hemoglobin levels which is insidious in presentation, often without any clinical signs. Progressive anemia in preterm infants is associated with poor weight gain, inability to take oral feeds, tachycardia and exacerbation of apneic, and bradycardic events. There remains a lack of consensus on treatment thresholds for RBC transfusion which vary considerably. This review elaborates on the current state of the problem, its implication for the premature infant including association with subphysiologic cerebral tissue oxygenation, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity. It outlines the impact of prophylaxis and treatment of anemia of prematurity and offers suggestions on improving monitoring and management of the condition."
35451633,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and the optimal intervention remains uncertain. To compare the mortality of primary peritoneal drainage versus primary peritoneal laparotomy as initial surgical intervention for NEC. All data were extracted from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Studies published up to December 2021. Patients with NEC. Studies centered on primary peritoneal drainage and primary peritoneal laparotomy as the initial surgical treatment. Mortality outcomes were available for both interventions. Randomized controlled trials, retrospective cohort studies, and case series in peer-reviewed journals. Language limited to English. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was used to evaluate mortality outcome. Subgroup analyses and linear regression were performed to ascertain the association between mortality pre-specified factors. Data of 1062 patients received peritoneal drainage and 2185 patients received peritoneal laparotomy from five case series, five retrospective cohort studies, and three randomized controlled trials. Peritoneal drainage caused similar mortality (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.99-2.26) compared with peritoneal laparotomy as initial surgical management for NEC infants. The subgroup analysis of study design, sample size, birth weight, and sex showed similar findings, but inconsistent results were found for country (USA: 1.47, 95% CI 0.90-2.41; Canada: 2.53, 95% CI 0.30-21.48; Australia: 10.29, 95% CI 1.03-102.75; Turkey: 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.63) and gestational age (age mean difference < 3: 1.23, 95% CI 0.72-2.11; age mean difference ≥ 3: 2.29, 95% CI 1.04-5.05). No statistically significance was found for the linear regression between mortality and sample size (P = 0.842), gestational age (P = 0.287), birth weight (P = 0.257), sex (P = 0.6). Small sample size, high heterogeneity, NEC, and spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) had to be analyzed together, lack of selection criteria for the future selection of an intervention, and no clear, standardized procedures. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in mortality between peritoneal drainage and laparotomy as initial surgical intervention. The results suggest that either intervention could be used in selected patients. What is Known: • Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and the optimal intervention remains uncertain. What is New: • No significant difference of mortality between peritoneal drainage and laparotomy as initial surgical intervention."
33498880,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the first cause of short bowel syndrome (SBS) in the neonate, is a serious neonatal gastrointestinal disease with an incidence of up to 11% in preterm newborns less than 1500 g of birth weight. The rate of severe NEC requiring surgery remains high, and it is estimated between 20-50%. Newborns who develop SBS need prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN), experience nutrient deficiency, failure to thrive and are at risk of neurodevelopmental impairment. Prevention of NEC is therefore mandatory to avoid SBS and its associated morbidities. In this regard, nutritional practices seem to play a key role in early life. Individualized medical and surgical therapies, as well as intestinal rehabilitation programs, are fundamental in the achievement of enteral autonomy in infants with acquired SBS. In this descriptive review, we describe the most recent evidence on nutritional practices to prevent NEC, the available tools to early detect it, the surgical management to limit bowel resection and the best nutrition to sustain growth and intestinal function."

36768793,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening disease that predominantly affects very low birth weight preterm infants. Development of NEC in preterm infants is accompanied by high mortality. Surgical treatment of NEC can be complicated by short bowel syndrome, intestinal failure, parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease, and neurodevelopmental delay. Issues surrounding pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of NEC remain unclear. This review summarizes data on prenatal risk factors for NEC, the role of pre-eclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation in the pathogenesis of NEC. The role of hypoxia in NEC is discussed. Recent data on the role of the intestinal microbiome in the development of NEC, and features of the metabolome that can serve as potential biomarkers, are presented. The Pseudomonadota phylum is known to be associated with NEC in preterm neonates, and the role of other bacteria and their metabolites in NEC pathogenesis is also discussed. The most promising approaches for preventing and treating NEC are summarized."
34704805,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is among the most relevant gastrointestinal diseases affecting mostly prematurely born infants with low birth weight. While intestinal dysbiosis has been proposed as one of the possible factors involved in NEC pathogenesis, the role of the gut microbiota remains poorly understood. In this study, the gut microbiota of preterm infants was explored to highlight differences in the composition between infants affected by NEC and infants prior to NEC development. A large-scale gut microbiome analysis was performed, including 47 shotgun sequencing data sets generated in the framework of this study, along with 124 retrieved from publicly available repositories. Meta-analysis led to the identification of preterm community state types (PT-CSTs), which recur in healthy controls and NEC infants. Such analyses revealed an overgrowth of a range of opportunistic microbial species accompanying the loss of gut microbial biodiversity in NEC subjects. Moreover, longitudinal insights into preterm infants prior to NEC development indicated Clostridium neonatale and Clostridium perfringens species as potential biomarkers for predictive early diagnosis of this disease. Furthermore, functional investigation of the enzymatic reaction profiles associated with pre-NEC condition suggested DL-lactate as a putative metabolic biomarker for early detection of NEC onset. IMPORTANCE Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe gastrointestinal disease occurring predominantly in premature infants whose etiology is still not fully understood. In this study, the analysis of infant fecal samples through shotgun metagenomics approaches revealed a marked reduction of the intestinal (bio) diversity and an overgrowth of (opportunistic) pathogens associated with the NEC development. In particular, dissection of the infant's gut microbiome before NEC diagnosis highlighted the potential involvement of Clostridium genus members in the progression of NEC. Remarkably, our analyses highlighted a gastrointestinal DL-lactate accumulation among NEC patients that might represent a novel potential functional biomarker for the early diagnosis of NEC."
34644520,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a debilitating disease in premature infants resulting from lung injury that disrupts alveolar and pulmonary vascular development. Despite the use of lung-protective ventilation and targeted oxygen therapy, BPD rates have not significantly changed over the last decade. Recent evidence suggests that sepsis and conditions initiating the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in preterm infants are key risk factors for BPD. However, the mechanisms by which sepsis-associated systemic inflammation and microbial dissemination program aberrant lung development are not fully understood. Progress has been made within the last 5 years with the inception of animal models allowing mechanistic investigations into neonatal acute lung injury and alveolar remodeling attributable to endotoxemia and necrotizing enterocolitis. These recent studies begin to unravel the pathophysiology of early endothelial immune activation via pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4 and disruption of critical lung developmental processes such as angiogenesis, extracellular matrix deposition, and ultimately alveologenesis. Here we review scientific evidence from preclinical models of neonatal sepsis-induced lung injury to new data emerging from clinical literature."
30384985,"The past decade of neonatal care has been highlighted by increased survival rates in smaller and more premature infants. Despite reduction in mortality associated with extreme prematurity, long term pulmonary morbidities remain a concern, with growing recognition of the clinical burden attributable to infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) -associated pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recent publications shed light on the critical contributions of maternal placental pathology and compromised intrauterine growth to fetal pulmonary vascular development. A body of literature has further clarified postnatal risk factors for PH, most notably the severity of BPD but surprisingly the additional presence of non-pulmonary morbidities including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Limitations of current diagnostics persist with growing consideration of novel echocardiographic approaches as well as complementary non-invasive biomarkers to better identify infants at risk. In 2015, a joint report published by the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society provided the first guidelines for the care of children with PH with limited content to address BPD-associated PH. These guidelines were expanded upon in an expert consensus report produced by the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet). These recommendations encouraged the use of standardized screening protocols and emphasized the importance of evaluation and treatment of comorbidities when PH is identified. Cardiac catheterization was recommended prior to initiation of therapy for more accurate quantification of pulmonary pressures, clarification of anatomy and guidance in the use of pharmacotherapy. Despite these guidelines, significant practice variation persists and gaps remain with respect to optimal evaluation and management of BPD-associated PH."

31838477,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a major cause for neonatal mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. The purpose of this review was to summarize evidence from systematic reviews of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) regarding antenatal and postnatal interventions for preventing NEC. PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library Databases, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Campbell Library were searched for meta-analyses in which NEC was reported as an outcome after antenatal or postnatal strategies. The AMSTAR instrument was used to evaluate quality of included reviews. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessment was used to evaluate certainty of evidence. We identified 98 meta-analyses of RCTs. The quality of included reviews was adequate, whereas the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low. Moderate certainty evidence showed a reduction in NEC following administration of a combination of species of probiotics, probiotics (any), antenatal corticosteroids in pregnant women at risk of preterm birth, and ibuprofen versus indomethacin for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). For surgical NEC, moderate certainty evidence showed an increased risk with lower (85-89%) oxygen saturation target levels, compared with higher (91-95%) oxygen saturation target levels. In conclusion, decreased risk of NEC is observed with probiotics, antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth, and ibuprofen versus indomethacin for treatment of PDA. Targeting lower oxygen saturations may increase the risk of surgical NEC, compared to targeting higher saturations."

34274152,"The recently recognized connection between the gut microbiota and pulmonary disease has been termed the gut-lung axis. However, broader connections link the gut and the lungs and these organ systems are tightly interrelated in both homeostasis and disease. This concept is often ignored in the compartmentalized treatment of pulmonary or gastrointestinal disease. In newborns, the most severe gastrointestinal complication of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, and the most severe pulmonary complication, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, both produce significant systemic morbidity. In this review, we highlight the often neglected pathophysiology of the gut-lung axis contributes to increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants with necrotizing enterocolitis."
36383399,"Transfusion-associated necrotising enterocolitis (TANEC) is a life-threatening disease with a poor prognosis in preterm infants. This study explored whether and how heme induces ferroptosis in TANEC gut injury. A TANEC mouse model and a cell culture system for heme and Caco-2 cells were established. Ferroptosis was assessed by measuring iron and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and mitochondrial morphology in intestinal tissues and Caco-2 cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction was evaluated by measuring mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and membrane potential using JC-1. The intestinal injury grade was higher in the anemia-transfusion group than in the control group (p <.0001). Higher intestinal iron concentration (p <.0001), elevated levels of lipid peroxidation MDA (p =.0021), and ferroptotic mitochondrial morphological changes were found in mice of the anemia-transfusion group; specific ferroptosis inhibitor could alleviate anemia-transfusion gut injury, suggesting that ferroptosis play a role in the TANEC gut injury. Next, we explored whether heme released by hemolysis of erythrocytes induces ferroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. The viability of Caco-2 cells significantly decreased after heme treatment (p <.0001). Iron accumulation, MDA elevated levels, and mitochondrial dysfunction also existed in the co-culture system, which ferroptosis inhibitors could reduce. In summary, ferroptosis was discovered in TANEC, and heme could induce ferroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells via mitochondrial dysfunction. Heme-inducing ferroptosis may be a possible mechanism and therapeutic target for TANEC."

Study design: An interventional randomized case-control study, registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03265782), was conducted on 60 preterm infants with gestational age ≤ 34 weeks, postnatal age of 2-7 d and color Doppler echocardiographic evidence of hsPDA. Neonates were randomly assigned to two groups: 30 received oral ibuprofen and 30 received oral paracetamol. With failure of ductal closure, a second course of ibuprofen or paracetamol was given. The included newborns were subjected to detailed history, clinical examination, laboratory investigations that included complete blood count, renal, and liver function tests and echocardiographic evaluation. Results: Oral paracetamol was as effective as ibuprofen for the closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with one course of treatment (p >.05). Moreover, oral paracetamol was superior to ibuprofen among neonates who needed second course of treatment with significant decrease in end diastolic flow velocity in the left pulmonary artery (0.35 ± 0.09 versus 0.19 ± 0.06, p =.014), right ventricular systolic pressure (40.50 ± 12.91 versus 20.50 ± 0.58, p =.016) and left atrium to aortic root ratio (1.23 ± 0.14 versus 1.07 ± 0.04, p =.046) when compared to ibuprofen group. Furthermore, the mean difference between pre- and post-treatment PDA size was significantly higher in the paracetamol group compared with ibuprofen group after the second course of treatment (1.07 ± 0.32 versus 0.73 ± 0.38, p =.024). Oral paracetamol was comparable with ibuprofen in terms of the rate of non-surgical ductal closure [28 (93.3%) versus 24 (80%), p =.591]. In addition, oral paracetamol was as safe as oral ibuprofen in terms of gastrointestinal perforation or bleeding, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, hepatic or renal dysfunction. Conclusions: Oral paracetamol is an effective and well-tolerated first-line drug treatment for PDA in premature infants."
35209998,The incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) has overall declined to 15% to 20% of preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g. One of the major complications of severe IVH is posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation (PHVD). Nearly 10% of all infants with IVH and 20% of infants with severe IVH will develop progressive PHVD requiring surgical intervention to prevent parenchymal damage in the developing brain. This review focuses on the controversies regarding posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus interventions with a focus on how to interpret recent data from trials that some have seen as heralding a call toward more aggressive intervention.
30771811,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of prematurity, with no current method for early diagnosis. Diagnosis is particularly challenging, frequently occurring after the disease has progressed to the point of significant and often irreversible intestinal damage. Biomarker research has tremendous potential to advance clinical management of NEC and our understanding of its pathogenesis. This review discusses the need for novel biomarkers in NEC management, evaluates studies investigating such biomarkers, and explains the difficulties associated with translating biomarker discovery into clinical use."
30196017,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a potentially devastating condition that preferentially affects premature and low birth weight infants, with approximately half requiring acute surgical intervention. Surgical consult should be considered early on, and deterioration despite maximal medical therapy or the finding of pneumoperitoneum are the strongest indications for emergent surgical intervention. There is no clear consensus on the optimal surgical approach between peritoneal drainage and laparotomy; the best course of action likely depends on the infant's comorbidities, hemodynamic status, size, disease involvement, and available resources. Patients who develop surgical NEC are at a significant risk for morbidity and mortality, with long-term complications including short bowel syndrome, growth failure, and neurodevelopmental impairment. Further research into strategies that optimize outcomes following surgery for NEC in the neonatal intensive care unit and long-term are paramount."
33958518,"Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious infection of the bowel wall induced by multiple pathological factors, which include inflammation and tissue invasion with bacteria known to cause severe infections. NEC is now understood to be several disease processes under one umbrella. The most common form occurs in premature infants and can exert significant impacts to preterm morbidity and mortality. (1) The pathogenesis of NEC is complex and involves a variety of factors, including the intestinal microbiota, the intestinal barrier, and the immune system."
31126684,"Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating gastrointestinal disease that primarily affects premature infants. Despite medical advances, mortality and morbidity from NEC are still unacceptably high. This is partly because of the lack of specific biomarkers and therapies for this disease. Availability of high-quality biological samples and the associated data from premature infants are key to advance our understanding of NEC, and for biomarker discovery and drug development. To that end, the NEC Society Biorepository was established with the goal of promoting studies in human infants through sharing specialized biospecimen and data procurement for NEC research."
35125082,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory bowel necrosis seen in premature infants. Although the etiopathogenesis of NEC is unclear, genetic factors may alter a patient's susceptibility, clinical course, and outcomes. This review draws from existing studies focused on individual genes and others based on microarray-based high-throughput discovery techniques. We have included evidence from our own studies and from an extensive literature search in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus. To avoid bias in the identification of studies, keywords were short-listed a priori from anecdotal experience and PubMed's Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) thesaurus."
30143341,"Enteral feeding and composition play a chief role in the prevention and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In the face of decades of research on this fatal disease, the exact mechanism of disease is still poorly understood. There is established evidence that providing mother's own breast milk and standardization of feeding regimens leads to a decreased risk for NEC. More recent studies have focused on the provision of donor human milk or an exclusive human milk diet in the endeavor to prevent NEC while still maintaining adequate nutrition to the premature infant. There is growing literature on the provision of specific human milk components and its effect on the incidence of NEC."
36653576,"Background and aim: A comprehensive understanding of endometriosis and its common gastrointestinal presentations are critical for gastroenterologists to ensure appropriate and timely screening and diagnosis. Endometriosis is a common inflammatory disease that frequently presents with gastrointestinal symptoms overlapping with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other gastrointestinal disorders. Many endometriosis patients first present to a gastroenterologist or generalist, which may prolong the time to diagnosis and appropriate care. (1,2) The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of IBS in women with endometriosis and to identify the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in women with endometriosis."
32008132,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a poorly defined disease that primarily affects preterm infants. There has not been much progress in the prevention or treatment of NEC since it became recognized as a common problem in preterm infants. Reasons for this lack of progress include the likelihood that different diseases are being put under the same moniker of ""NEC,"" similar to using ""diabetes"" for the different diseases it represents. In order to make progress, better delineation of the phenotypes that present as NEC will be necessary to clearly establish their pathophysiology, find specific and sensitive biomarkers, and establish preventative regimens. In this review, we summarize some of the entities that are being called NEC, discuss the pathophysiology of the most classic form of NEC, and provide an overview of how we might proceed in the future to make progress in this field."

35210000,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) emergency in the neonatal intensive care unit. Despite advances in medical care, mortality and morbidity from NEC have not changed. This is likely due to the lack of a clear understanding of this multifactorial disease, and reliable biomarkers for accurate diagnosis of NEC. Currently, the diagnosis of NEC is made by a combination of nonspecific clinical signs, symptoms, and radiological findings. Though biomarkers have been studied extensively, none offer an acceptable sensitivity or specificity to be used. This review will focus on the available literature on biomarkers for preterm NEC, acknowledging the limitations in studies including the variability of inclusion criteria, and most importantly, the lack of gold standard case definition for NEC."
37396706,"Viral gastroenteritis is the most common viral illness that affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, causing inflammation and irritation of the lining of the stomach and intestines. Common signs and symptoms associated with this condition include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dehydration. The infections commonly involved in viral gastroenteritis are rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus, which spread through the fecal-oral and contact routes and cause non-bloody diarrhea. These infections can affect both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Since the pandemic in 2019, coronavirus gastroenteritis has increased in incidence and prevalence. Morbidity and mortality rates from viral gastroenteritis have declined significantly over the years due to early recognition, treatment with oral rehydration salts, and prompt vaccination. Improved sanitation measures have also played a key role in reducing the transmission of infection. In addition to viral hepatitis causing liver disease, herpes virus, and cytomegalovirus are responsible for ulcerative GI disease. They are associated with bloody diarrhea and commonly occur in im-munocompromised individuals. Hepatitis viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, herpesvirus 8, and human papillomavirus have been involved in benign and malignant diseases. This mini review aims to list different viruses affecting the GI tract. It will cover common symptoms aiding in diagnosis and various important aspects of each viral infection that can aid diagnosis and management. This will help primary care physicians and hospitalists diagnose and treat patients more easily."
30082194,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a devastating surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Slow but steady progress has been made in past years searching for novel biomarkers of NEC, for both surveillance and diagnostic purposes. This review primarily focuses on recent discoveries: clinical applications of different categories of biomarkers for surveillance, early diagnosis, and predicting severity and prognosis; and understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms as a basis to rationalize the search for 'gut-associated specific biomarkers' of NEC. An important next step is to collaborate with our industrial partners to develop point-of-care tests, and to discover novel and gut-associated specific biomarkers that can be used for surveillance and early diagnosis of NEC in routine clinical settings."
37452811,"Description: Belching, bloating, and abdominal distention are all highly prevalent gastrointestinal symptoms and account for some of the most common reasons for patient visits to outpatient gastroenterology practices. These symptoms are often debilitating, affecting patients' quality of life, and contributing to work absenteeism. Belching and bloating differ in their pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management, and there is limited evidence available for their various treatments. Therefore, the purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update is to provide best practice advice based on both controlled trials and observational data for clinicians covering clinical features, diagnostics, and management considerations that include dietary, gut-directed behavioral, and drug therapies."
30145059,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a common morbidity of prematurity, affects 5-10% of premature infants with a birthweight < 1500 g. The added cost remains unclear. Multiple studies report the cost of care for an infant with NEC as higher than that of well premature infants, but these studies are fraught with limitations. Surgical intervention and type of surgery appear to impact overall costs. Health care resource utilization extends beyond the birth hospitalization, particularly in those infants requiring surgery, and persists to at least three years of age. This narrative review of the literature reveals a paucity of studies and significant methodological deficiencies in most included studies. Further studies of the cost of NEC need to address the issues of significant confounding in this complex population."
34024450,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is a serious and yet incompletely understood gastrointestinal disease of infancy that predominately impacts premature neonates. Prevention is a key strategy for the management of necrotizing enterocolitis. Although postnatal risk factors have been the focus of prevention efforts, obstetric complications, including intrauterine inflammation and infection, growth restriction, preeclampsia, and prenatal medications, have been associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. This article reviews the evidence behind the prenatal risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis, and discusses how these risk factors may elucidate the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis and provide insight into prevention and treatment."
30771813,Current assessment for and diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remain inadequate. The introduction of interrogating bowel with ultrasound when NEC is suspected or when NEC has occurred presents greater opportunity to characterize the physical changes that have occurred in the bowel wall structures. The evaluation of bowel by ultrasound has been shown to have high specificity for bowel necrosis. There are current barriers in adoption of these techniques because they have not been integrated into routine diagnostic imaging and are not well incorporated in neonatal medicine.
37368219,"Chronic diarrhea in children is challenging both with regards to etiological diagnosis and for management. Etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms vary widely from neonates to adolescents. Congenital or genetic causes are more frequent in neonates, while infections, allergy and immune-mediated mechanisms are more frequent in childhood. A thorough history and proper physical examination are required to decide for further diagnostic evaluation. The approach to a child with chronic diarrhea should be age specific and based predominantly on the pathophysiological mechanism involved. The nature of the stool like watery, bloody or fatty (steatorrhea) can suggest the probable etiology and organ system involved. After routine tests, evaluation with specific serological tests, imaging, endoscopy (gastroscopy / colonoscopy), histopathology of intestinal mucosa, breath tests or radionuclide imaging may be required to make a definitive diagnosis. Genetic evaluation is important in congenital diarrheas, monogenic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and immunodeficiency disorders. Management is aimed at stabilization, nutritional support and etiology specific treatment. Specific therapy can be as simple as exclusion of specific nutrient or as complicated as small bowel transplant. Evaluation and management require expertise and thus patients need to be referred in a timely fashion. This will minimise morbidity including nutritional consequences and improve outcome."
29980346,"Background / purpose: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of prematurity that develops after feeding, often without warning, and results in diffuse intestinal necrosis leading to sepsis and death in many cases. The lack of improvement in overall survival is influenced by nonspecific diagnostic modalities as well as inexact and nonpersonalized treatment strategies. (1,2) The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of a novel, noninvasive, and inexpensive method of assessing intestinal perfusion in preterm infants with NEC."
34829543,"Preterm babies are highly susceptible to oxidative stress (OS) due to an imbalance between the oxidant and antioxidant systems. The generation of free radicals (FR) induces oxidative damage to multiple body organs and systems. OS is the main factor responsible for the development of typical premature infant diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, kidney damage, eryptosis, and also respiratory distress syndrome and patent ductus arteriosus. Many biomarkers have been detected to early identify newborns at risk of developing a free radical-mediated disease and to investigate new antioxidant strategies. This review reports the current knowledge on OS in the preterm newborns and the newest findings concerning the use of OS biomarkers as diagnostic tools, as well as in implementing antioxidant therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of these diseases and their sequelae."
30989465,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most severe diseases of preterm neonates and has a high mortality rate. With the development of inspection techniques and new biomarkers, the diagnostic accuracy of NEC is constantly improving. The most recognized potential risk factors include prematurity, formula-feeding, infection, and microbial dysbiosis. With further understanding of the pathogenesis, more effective prevention and therapies will be applied to clinical or experimental NEC. At present, such new potential prevention and therapies for NEC are mainly focused on the Toll-like receptor 4 inflammatory signaling pathway, the repair of intestinal barrier function, probiotics, antioxidative stress, breast-feeding, and immunomodulatory agents. Many new studies have changed our understanding of the pathogenesis of NEC and improve our approaches for preventing and treating of NEC each year. This review provides an overview of the recent researches focused on clinical or experimental NEC and highlights the advances made within the past 5 years toward the development of new potential preventive approaches and therapies for this disease."
36572621,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is a severe gastrointestinal disease of the infant. It most commonly targets those that are born prematurely. NEC has been associated with initiation of feeds and in most cases, it can be managed with antibiotics and bowel rest. However, in up to half of the cases, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and failure of medical treatment will require surgical intervention. The following review will discuss the surgical approach to managing NEC, based on an updated review of practice patterns and recently published literature."
30172660,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease of preterm infants and associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Although the pathogenesis of NEC is not clear, microbial dysbiosis, with a bloom of the phylum Proteobacteria, has been reported. Antibiotics and the use of H2 blockers, which affect the gut microbiome, are associated with increased incidence of NEC. In association with dysbiosis, inflammatory processes are upregulated with increased Toll-like receptor signaling, leading to translocation of nuclear factor kappa-β, a transcription factor that induces transcription of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Microbial metabolites, short chain fatty acids including acetate and butyrate, may modulate immunity, inflammation, intestinal integrity and regulate transcription by epigenetic mechanisms. Evaluation of microbiome and metabolome may provide biomarkers for early diagnosis of NEC and microbial therapeutic approaches to correct microbial dysbiosis."
32855506,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized infants. First classified through Bell staging in 1978, a number of additional definitions of NEC have been proposed in the subsequent decades. In this review, we summarize eight current definitions of NEC, and explore similarities and differences in clinical signs and radiographic features included within these definitions, as well as their limitations. We highlight the importance of a global consensus on defining NEC to improve NEC research and outcomes, incorporating input from participants at an international NEC conference. We also highlight the important role of patient-families in helping to redefine NEC."
30771816,"Progressing necrotizing enterocolitis research is difficult because the disease is variable in presentation, there are difficulties in making a precise diagnosis, a reliable agreed case-definition is currently lacking, and there is a paucity of preclinical research to identify etiologic targets. The major challenges of the cost of clinical trials and need for long-term outcome ascertainment could be eased through incorporation of novel randomization approaches and data collection into routine care, and collaboration between public-sector and industry funders."
34836137,"(1) Background: The tolerance of preterm newborns for the high nutritional intakes given by parenteral nutrition (PN) is still debated because of the risk of metabolic complications. Despite enteral nutrition (EN) being the preferred route of nutrition, an exclusive enteral feeding is not always possible, as in preterm newborns, the gut is immature and less tolerant of EN. We aimed to study the impact of a minimal enteral feeding (MEF) on the possible early metabolic complications of PN in a cohort of preterms with gestational age at birth GA ≤ 29 + 6 / 7 weeks of postmenstrual age. (2) Methods: We divided the study sample in two cohorts: 1) Late-Feeding (cohort 1), newborns who received MEF starting from the 8th day of age, and (2) Early-Feeding (cohort 2), newborns who received MEF, consisting of the administration of at least 4-5 mL / kg / day by the enteral route, in the first 7 days of age. The primary outcome of the study was the rate of at least one metabolic complication, including hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or metabolic acidosis. (3) Results: We enrolled 80 newborns (Late-Feeding cohort 51 vs. Early-Feeding cohort 29). The rate of all metabolic complications was statistically higher in the Late-Feeding cohort compared to the Early-Feeding cohort. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that late administration of MEF negatively influenced the rate of all metabolic complications. (4) Conclusions: Early minimal administration of EN is associated with less frequent PN-related metabolic side effects and a higher rate of survival in critically ill newborns."
33312348,"Exosomes are a subtype of extracellular vesicles. They contain bioactive molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Among the currently described exosomes, a majority are potential candidates for the diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In this work, we reviewed existing literature reports on exosomes and explored their roles in NEC. Exosomes derived from intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) participates in the development of intestinal diseases, thus can potentially be utilized as biomarkers for NEC. Besides, exosomes of human milk have been demonstrated to protect IECs from oxidative stress, stimulate intestinal stem cells activity, improve the proliferation and migration of IECs, and lower the incidence and severity of experimental NEC. Further, exosomes produced by stem cells can reduce the severity of experimental NEC and protect the intestinal barrier function during NEC. Conclusively, exosomes have been shown to influence the pathogenesis of NEC and exert a protective effect on NEC. However, additional investigations would be urgently necessary to comprehensively elucidate the underlying mechanisms of exosomes in NEC."

31575803,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been recognized for well over 5 decades yet remains the most common life-threatening surgical emergency in the newborn. The incidence of NEC has decreased steadily in preterm and very-low-birthweight infants over several decades and is typically uncommon in term newborns and infants with a birthweight greater than 2,500 g. Evidence accumulating during the past decade, however, suggests that practitioners should consider NEC in this broader subset of term infants with chromosomal and congenital anomalies complicated by heart or gastrointestinal defects when signs and symptoms of feeding intolerance, abdominal illness, or sepsis are present. The short- and long-term consequences of NEC are devastating in all infants, and although early disease recognition and treatment are essential, promoting human milk feeding as a primary modality in prevention is critical. This article highlights our current understanding of the pathophysiology, the clinical presentation, the risk factors for NEC in term infants compared with premature infants, and the treatment of NEC and discusses strategies in the prevention of NEC. Finally, we review the long-term consequences of NEC and the importance of primary care practitioners in the long-term care of infants after hospitalization for NEC."
35110122,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies in the newborn infant, and the incidence varies between 3% and 15% in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). It has a high risk of mortality and both short- and long-term morbidity which severely impacts the quality of life in the survivors. Lack of specific clinical and laboratory findings makes early diagnosis difficult for the clinician and sometimes results in overtreatment for feeding intolerance which is quite frequent in preterms and can easily be confused with NEC. The fact that there are many definitions and presentations of NEC even complicates the management. This review aims to summarize the guideline of the Turkish Neonatal Society for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of NEC for the clinician taking care of preterms. Etiopathogenesis and various clinical pictures of NEC, as well as diagnostic methods, are defined. Treatment and prognosis are discussed in detail with reference to current literature and preventive strategies are summarized based on evidence. Finally, the approach to baby presenting with suspected NEC is summarized in an algorithm."

37295298,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal inflammatory disorder, most prevalent in premature infants, and associated with a high mortality rate that has remained unchanged in the past two decades. NEC is characterized by inflammation, ischemia, and impaired microcirculation in the intestine. Preclinical studies by our group have led to the discovery of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) as a promising non-invasive intervention in protecting the intestine against ischemia-induced damage during early-stage NEC. RIC involves the administration of brief reversible cycles of ischemia and reperfusion in a limb (similar to taking standard blood pressure measurement) which activate endogenous protective signaling pathways that are conveyed to distant organs such as the intestine. RIC targets the intestinal microcirculation and by improving blood flow to the intestine, reduces the intestinal damage of experimental NEC and prolongs survival. A recent Phase I safety study by our group demonstrated that RIC was safe in preterm infants with NEC. A phase II feasibility randomized controlled trial involving 12 centers in 6 countries is currently underway, to investigate the feasibility of RIC as a treatment for early-stage NEC in preterm neonates. This review provides a brief background on RIC as a therapeutic strategy and summarizes the progression of RIC as a treatment for NEC from preclinical investigation to clinical evaluation."
30499415,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an important complication for premature newborns. Infants who survive NEC have a greater possibility of poor long-term physiological and neurodevelopmental growth. The objective of this paper is to give a comprehensive description of the long-term consequences of NEC. Despite the rise in incidence of NEC there is a scarcity of data regarding long-term outcomes of these infants that can be divided into two groups. The first group includes gastrointestinal complications that could occur in relation to the bowel disease, the surgical treatment and quality of the residual bowel. These complications are strictures and short bowel syndrome (SBS). Intestinal strictures are a common occurance after recovery from NEC that should be investigated with a contrast study in case of suspicious clinical findings of bowel obstruction or before reversal ostomy. After this diagnostic investigation, if a stricture is detected in a symptomatic patient, resection of the affected loop of bowel with anastomosis is required. SBS is the result of a massive intestinal resection or of a dysfunctional residual bowel and it can occur in a fourth of patients affected by NEC. The second group includes neurodevelopmental impairment and growth. Neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients after NEC recovery have not been widely reported. Infants with NEC is a population of patients at high risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes whose cause can be multifactorial and linked to perinatal events, severity of disease, surgical treatment and its complications and hospitalization. Understanding the morbidity of NEC with a longterm follow-up would aid neonatologists and pediatric surgeons to make informed decisions in providing care for these patients. Further research on this topic is needed."
34727861,"With the recognition that only 2% of the human genome encodes for a protein, a large part of the ""non-coding"" portion is now being evaluated for a regulatory role in cellular processes. These non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are subdivided based on the size of the nucleotide transcript into microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), but most of our attention has been focused on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human health and disease. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an inflammatory bowel necrosis affecting preterm infants, has a multifactorial, unclear etiopathogenesis, and we have no specific biomarkers for diagnosis or the impact of directed therapies. The information on ncRNAs, in general, and particularly in NEC, is limited. Increasing information from other inflammatory bowel disorders suggests that these transcripts may play an important role in intestinal inflammation. Here, we review ncRNAs for definitions, classifications, and possible roles in prematurity and NEC using some preliminary information from our studies and from an extensive literature search in multiple databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Science Direct. miRNAs will be described in another manuscript in this series, hence in this manuscript we mainly focus on lncRNAs."
34469367,"Background: Abdominal x-ray (KUB) routinely aids in detecting necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), one of the most serious neonatal intestinal diseases. However, a KUB may miss up to 50% of the early signs of NEC. Recent advances in abdominal ultrasound (AUS) can expedite this diagnosis and improve clinical management. (1) We sought to determine the accuracy of AUS in detecting NEC in preterm infants. (2) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of preterm infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation who underwent AUS and KUB within 72 hours of each other."
33902422,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is one of the most frequent and severe gastrointestinal diseases that affect preterm newborns in Neonatal Intensive Care Units. It was firstly described in 1960s, but this clinical entity was not widely recognized until the advent of modern neonatal intensive care. The disease is characterized by submucosal edema, infiltration of intestinal wall by immune cells, specifically neutrophils and, in severe forms, wall necrosis that leads to intestinal perforation. Its incidence is inversely associated to birth weight and gestational age. Necrotizing enterocolitis has been responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality (15-30%), despite improvements made in neonatal care in the last decades. The challenge is to optimize strategies for early diagnosis, define the best medical and surgical treatments and standardize preventive measures. Several biomarkers have been proposed for the early prediction of necrotizing enterocolitis onset in preterm newborns and can be useful not only for diagnostic purposes but also for prediction of disease progression and severity. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the most recent evidence regarding the diagnosis and prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis. This manuscript contributes to clinical decision-making in preterm neonates at high risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis."

(3) Conclusion: The current evidence suggests that antibiotic treatment for infants with NEC is not beneficial."
30387398,"NEC is a devastating disease that, once present, is very difficult to treat. In the absence of an etiologic treatment, preventive measures are required. Advances in decoding the pathophysiology of NEC are being made but a more comprehensive understanding is needed for the targeting of preventative strategies. A better definition of the disease as well as diagnostic criteria are needed to be able to specifically label a disease as NEC. Multiple environmental factors combined with host susceptibility appear to contribute to enhanced risks for developing this disease. Several different proximal pathways are involved, all leading to a common undesired outcome: Intestinal necrosis. The most common form of this disease appears to involve inflammatory pathways that are closely meshed with the intestinal microbiota, where a dysbiosis may result in dysregulated inflammation. The organisms present in the intestinal tract prior to the onset of NEC along with their diversity and functional capabilities are just beginning to be understood. Fulfillment of postulates that support causality for particular microorganisms is needed if bacteriotherapies are to be intelligently applied for the prevention of NEC. Identification of molecular effector pathways that propagate inflammation, understanding of, even incipient role of genetic predisposition and of miRNAs may help solve the puzzle of this disease and may bring the researchers closer to finding a treatment. Despite recent progress, multiple limitations of the current animal models, difficulties related to studies in humans, along with the lack of a ""clear"" definition will continue to make it a very challenging disease to decipher."
36034384,Background: The current indications based on the clinicopathological parameters for predicting the need for surgery in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are still limited. This study retrospectively analyzes the characteristics of neonatal NEC and aims to identify the risk factors for surgical intervention in NEC. (1) Methods: A total of 524 neonates with NEC were retrospectively reviewed. (2) Results: The overall mortality rate was 40.6%. (n = 216). (3) Conclusions: The current study identified the risk factors for surgical intervention in NEC and provided a nomogram for predicting the need for surgery in NEC.
36142816,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of mortality in premature infants. However, the pathophysiology and influence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) have not been sufficiently elucidated. We performed a scoping review to investigate current knowledge on the influence of Tregs in NEC, and to investigate the predictive value of Treg number in NEC development. Pubmed, Embase, Prospero and Cochrane Library were searched during December 2020. Primary research articles discussing Tregs and NEC development written in English were selected. Two reviewers screened title and abstract for relevance, after which full-text screening was performed. A total of 20 articles were selected-13 of the articles discussed studies performed in animal models, while 8 used human neonate data. One study discussed both animal and human data. It was shown that after NEC diagnosis or induction, Treg levels were decreased while Th17 levels were increased. No studies were found which investigated the predictive value of Treg number in NEC development. A reduced Treg level is found in animals and neonates with NEC. The question remains whether this effect is a factor on the causal pathway of NEC development or a bystander effect. Future research focusing on the pathophysiological timeline of NEC and the involvement of Tregs is required for better understanding of this disease."
36621416,"In this review, we provide a historical perspective on probiotic use in preterm infants. We review recent data on the treatment effects of probiotics on necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and mortality. We highlight guidance statements from professional societies and organizations, discussing key points within the context of the currently available evidence from both randomized trials and cohort studies. Finally, we summarize experiences from several North American centers that have reported on the routine use of probiotics, including our center. Our goal is to highlight some of the considerations and complexities surrounding routine probiotics use in preterm infants."
36604292,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Despite decades of research in NEC, no reliable biomarkers can accurately diagnose NEC or predict patient prognosis. The recent emergence of multi-omics could potentially shift NEC biomarker discovery, particularly when evaluated using systems biology techniques. Furthermore, the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in analyzing this' big data 'could enable novel interpretations of NEC subtypes, disease progression, and potential therapeutic targets, allowing for integration with personalized medicine approaches. In this review, we evaluate studies using omics technologies and machine learning in the diagnosis of NEC. Future implications and challenges inherent to the field are also discussed."
35241991,"We present the case of a breast-fed preterm infant with postnatally acquired cytomegalovirus (CMV) and severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) associated with CMV. The infant had persistent severe thrombocytopenia with clinical deterioration despite multiple platelet transfusions and maximal medical treatment. Surgical intervention was not feasible owing to the instability of the infant's condition. Upon identification of CMV in urine, intravenous ganciclovir was initiated with significant clinical improvement. We also present a literature review of cases of CMV-related NEC or other gastrointestinal complications in preterm and term infants."
34090670,Background / purpose: Despite improvements in neonatal care the outcomes of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) remain unchanged over previous decades. The study aims to explore whether different indications for surgical intervention in NEC are associated with timing of surgery and outcomes. (1) Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). (2) Results: A total of 524 infants were included. (1) Conclusion: The timing of surgery in NEC is associated with the type of NEC and the type of surgical intervention.
32953856,"Background: Hepatic portal venous gas in infants is frequently due to late presentation of necrotizing enterocolitis which is considered a relative indicator for surgical intervention. (1) However, the natural history of hepatic portal venous gas in infants is not well defined. (2) We sought to determine the natural history of hepatic portal venous gas in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis. (3) Methods: We performed a retrospective review of infants with hepatic portal venous gas and necrotizing enterocolitis from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015."
30582482,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a frequent and severe life-threatening disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract of preterm infants. Given that NEC occurs in a well-defined population of patients, there might be a considerable benefit in identifying specific pharmacological and nutritional preventive strategies, that could reduce the incidence of NEC. Amongst nutritional strategies emphasis has been put on the use of probiotics. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize currently available evidence on the role of probiotics in general, as well as the role of specific probiotic strains or their combinations, in the prevention of NEC."
35128909,"Background: Recently, blood monocyte concentration has been introduced as an inventive biomarker for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in low birth weight neonate; therefore, we aimed to examine and compare blood monocyte counts in preterm neonates with and without NEC. (1) Methods: This case-control study was conducted on preterm neonates with and without NEC. (2) Results: The mean monocyte count was significantly higher in NEC group compared to the control group (P = 0.001)."

31077334,"Background: Neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) cause significant neonatal mortality and morbidity despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Enhancing host defense and modulating inflammation by using lactoferrin as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of sepsis, NEC, or both, may improve clinical outcomes. (1) We hypothesized that lactoferrin would decrease the incidence of sepsis and NEC in preterm infants. (2) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of preterm infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation who received lactoferrin or placebo in addition to standard care."
30100524,"The specific cause of what is commonly referred to as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) disease has been elusive largely because it is becoming clear that this entity represents more than one disease with multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, finding clear and consistent diagnostic biomarkers will be difficult until the different subsets of what we are calling this disease are better delineated. In this introductory chapter, we discuss different disease entities that are frequently termed ""NEC"" in the newborn infant. We hope this will set the stage for more focused research and development of preventative measures for at least the most common forms of this disease."

31238334,"In recent years, several studies have shown that premature infants who develop NEC frequently display enteric dysbiosis with increased Gram-negative bacteria for several days to weeks prior to NEC onset. The importance of these findings, for the possibility of a causal role of these bacteria in NEC pathogenesis, and for potential value of gut dysbiosis as a biomarker of NEC, is well-recognized. In this review, we present current evidence supporting the association between NEC in premature infants and enteric dysbiosis, and its evaluation using the Bradford Hill criteria for causality. To provide an objective appraisal, we developed a novel scoring system for causal inference. Despite important methodological and statistical limitations, there is support for the association from several large studies and a meta-analysis. The association draws strength from strong biological plausibility of a role of Gram-negative bacteria in NEC and from evidence for temporality, that dysbiosis may antedate NEC onset. The weakness of the association is in the low level of consistency across studies, and the lack of specificity of effect. There is a need for an improved definition of dysbiosis, either based on a critical threshold of relative abundances or at higher levels of taxonomic resolution."
32843076,"Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are serious emergencies in the neonatal period. Although these conditions are recognized as distinct pathologies, literature reports suggest that recurrent episodes of SVT may predispose patients to NEC via disturbances in mesenteric blood flow and a decrease in tissue perfusion.

32615312,"Background: There is no clear consensus on the optimal operative management of premature infants with surgical necrotizing enterocolitis (sNEC) or spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP); thus, a protocol was developed to guide surgical decision making regarding initial peritoneal drainage (PD) versus initial laparotomy (LAP). We sought to evaluate outcomes after implementation of the protocol. (1) Methods: A retrospective review of infants with sNEC or SIP was performed. (2) Results: A total of 40 infants were included in the study."
33447301,"The utilization of immunotherapy is increasing to the point of becoming the fifth pillar of management alongside surgical intervention, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy. However, gastrointestinal adverse effects and toxicities have been frequently cited with its use. As per literature, the most common adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors is watery and non-bloody diarrhea. Adoptive cell therapy can lead to delayed, on-target but off-tumor adverse effects which are unknown and may be life-threatening. The use of anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibodies can lead to bowel perforations, whereas epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and anti-HER2 agents are frequently associated with diarrhea. Minimal adverse effects have been associated with therapeutic cancer vaccines; however, additional studies are needed to determine their efficacy and potential toxicities. To provide an in-depth review of the gastrointestinal side effects of immunotherapeutic agents, we performed a thorough literature search using multiple online search engines such as PubMed, Google Scholar and Ovid MEDLINE, along with a review of the guidelines from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Cancer Research Institute on immunotherapy. In this systematic review, we detail the gastrointestinal adverse effects of immunotherapy and describe their management. With the advent of newer immunotherapeutic agents and the consistent approval of current agents by FDA for a wide spectrum of cancers, it is vital for physicians to familiarize themselves with their adverse effects for prompt diagnosis and early intervention to decrease adverse outcomes."

30656552,"Increasing evidence indicates that many of the health beneficial effects associated with the establishment of a symbiotic gut microbiota are driven by bacterial metabolic by-products.The term ""postbiotics"" indicates any soluble factor resulting from the metabolic activity of a live bacteria or any released molecule capable of providing health benefits through a direct or indirect mechanism.Alterations in preterm gut colonization associated with the intestinal barrier immaturity and the increased reactivity of the intestinal mucosa to colonizing bacteria have been implicated in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis. Recent advances in the comprehension of the postbiotic biological effects and related mechanisms, some of them reviewed here, indicate that postbiotics may be a promising effective preventive strategy against necrotizing enterocolitis while avoiding the risk of administering live microorganisms to preterm infants that could translocate and cause infection. However, data from trials investigating the efficacy of postbiotics for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants are needed, and issues regarding their optimal regimen and start and duration of treatment need to be addressed."

36068527,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating gastrointestinal disease that affects newborns, particularly preterm infants, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. No effective therapeutic strategies to decrease the incidence and severity of NEC have been developed to date. Stem cell therapy has been explored and even applied in various diseases, including gastrointestinal disorders. Animal studies on stem cell therapy have made great progress, and the anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and intestinal barrier enhancing effects of stem cells may be protective against NEC clinically. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic mechanisms through which stem cells may function in the treatment of NEC."
32439118,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a complex inflammatory necrosis of the neonatal intestine, which is likely to require a multipronged approach for prevention and treatment. Despite identifying and defining NEC as a disease entity several decades back, no major progress has been made toward its early identification, treatment, or prevention. This article reviews the latest research strategies that are currently ongoing for early diagnosis and monitoring and prevention of the disease.

32855511,"The 2019 Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Symposium expanded upon the NEC Society's goals of bringing stakeholders together to discuss cutting-edge science, potential therapeutics and preventative measures, as well as the patient-family perspectives of NEC. The Symposium facilitated discussions and shared knowledge with the overarching goal of creating ""A World Without NEC."" To accomplish this goal, new research to advance the state of the science is necessary. Over the last decade, several established investigators have significantly improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of NEC and they have paved the way for the next generation of clinician-scientists funded to perform NEC research. This article will serve to highlight the contributions of these young clinician-scientists that seek to elucidate how immune, microbial and nervous system dysregulation contributes to the pathophysiology of NEC."
34626783,Background: Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a rare non-immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergy with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) -like symptoms which requires differential diagnosis as treatments differ. (1) We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of FPIES patients with NEC-like symptoms. (2) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with FPIES who were admitted to our hospital between January 2010 and December 2017.
31919288,"The goal of the NEC-Zero project is to reduce the burden of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) by increasing access to evidence-based tools to help clinicians and parents integrate evidence into daily care. It involves (a) human milk feeding with prioritized mother's own milk; (b) use of a unit-adopted standardized feeding protocol; (c) a unit-adopted strategy for timely recognition that integrates risk awareness and a structured communication tool when symptoms develop; and (d) stewardship of empiric antibiotics and avoidance of antacids. A toolkit for caregivers and parents was developed to make implementation consistent. For clinicians the toolkit includes: the GutCheckNEC risk score, a structured communication tool, the ""Avoiding NEC"" checklist, and the NEC-Zero website. For parents, NEC-Zero tools include the website, three educational brochures in English and Spanish, and a collaborative care video produced with the NEC Society. This article describes the toolkit and how it has been accessed and used."
31305401,"The purpose of this study was to explore the diagnostic significance of abdominal sonography (AUS) in infants with Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit to better evaluate the ability of AUS to differentiate necrotizing enterocolitis from other intestinal diseases.All patients diagnosed with NEC at the Department of General Surgery and Neonatal Surgery, Qilu Children's Hospital between 1st, Jun, 2010 and 30th, Dec, 2015. The logistic regression analysis and the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUCs) were also used to identify the sonographic factors for diagnosing NEC.For the entire cohort of 91 patients, we divided these patients into suspected NEC (n = 35) group and definite NEC (n = 56) group. After adjusting for competing sonographic factors, we identified that thick bowel wall (more than 2.5 mm) (P =.013, OR: 1.246), intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis) (P =.002, OR: 1.983), portal venous gas (P =.022, OR: 1.655) and reduced peristalsis (P =.011, OR: 1.667) were independent diagnostic factors associated with NEC. We built a logistic model to diagnose NEC according to the results of multivariable logistic regression analysis. We found the AUROC for thick bowel wall (more than 2.5 mm), intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis), portal venous gas and reduced peristalsis were significantly lower than the AUROC for the logistic model was 0.841 (95% CI: 0.669 to 0.946).We found that thick bowel wall (more than 2.5 mm), intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis), portal venous gas and reduced peristalsis were independent diagnostic factors associated with NEC. The logistic model was significantly superior to the single sonographic parameter for diagnosing NEC."
