37072094,"Lumbar disc herniations are common causes of lower back pain, neurological dysfunction, and buttock / leg pain. Herniation refers to the displacement of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc through the annulus fibrosus, thereby causing pressure on the neural elements. The sequalae of lumbar disc herniations range in severity from mild low back and buttock pain to severe cases of inability to ambulate and cauda equina syndrome. Diagnosis is achieved with a thorough history and physical examination along with advanced imaging. Treatment plans are dictated by corresponding patient symptoms and examination findings with their imaging. Most patients can experience relief with nonsurgical measures. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, surgery may be appropriate."
34099604,"While buttock pain is a common complaint in sports medicine, deep gluteal syndrome (DGS) is a rare entity. DGS has been proposed as a unifying term referring to symptoms attributed to the various pain generators located in this region. While not all-inclusive, the diagnosis of DGS allows for focus on pathology of regionally associated muscles, tendons, and nerves in the clinical evaluation and management of posterior hip and buttock complaints. An understanding of the anatomic structures and their kinematic and topographic relationships in the deep gluteal space is pivotal in making accurate diagnoses and providing effective treatment. Because presenting clinical features may be unrevealing while imaging studies and diagnostic procedures lack supportive evidence, precise physical examination is essential in obtaining accurate diagnoses. Management of DGS involves focused rehabilitation with consideration of still clinically unproven adjunctive therapies, image-guided injections, and surgical intervention in refractory cases."
33842025,"Background: Proximal hamstring tendinopathy affects athletic and non-athletic populations and is associated with longstanding buttock pain. The condition is common in track and field, long distance running and field-based sports. Management options need to be evaluated to direct appropriate clinical management. (1) The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, non-surgical, physiotherapy-based treatment for proximal hamstring tendinopathy. (2) Methods: A prospective, single-centre, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted."
31169362,"The sacroiliac joint may be a primary source of pain in patients complaining of low back and / or buttock pain. Nonsurgical treatment of sacroiliac joint pain typically includes structured core and pelvic muscle flexibility and strengthening; pharmaceutical management through oral and injectable medication; and ablation procedures. For patients who do not improve with comprehensive, nonoperative treatment, surgical fusion of the sacroiliac joint is an option with overall good reported outcomes and high patient satisfaction. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approaches have been shown to have lower morbidity and earlier recovery than traditional open approaches. To date, the majority of published clinical studies on MIS sacroiliac joint fusion are industry-sponsored and predominantly using one system (ingrowth triangular titanium rods). These include two level 1 randomized controlled trials comparing MIS sacroiliac joint fusion to nonoperative management, with results favoring surgery."
31864570,"Ischiofemoral impingement is becoming a more recognized source of buttock pain that occurs as the lesser trochanter of the femur approximates the lateral margin of the ischium. Abnormal bony structure and alignment of the hip joint and / or faulty dynamic movement patterns may decrease the ischiofemoral space and compress the structures that are found within the space, including the quadratus femoris, proximal hamstring tendons, and sciatic nerve. The ischiofemoral space is reduced by structural factors including an increase in femoral anteversion and femoral neck angle. Dynamic assessment of the hip region may include the Craig test and total rotational range of motion of the hip joint, as well as the ischiofemoral impingement test and the long-stride walking test. The combination of structural and dynamic assessment of the hip region may help determine the presence of ischiofemoral impingement and direct appropriate management of the condition."
36127925,"The Spondyloarthritis (SpA) represents a group of rheumatic inflammatory entities that share clinical, laboratory and imaging features, including Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). Axial involvement may occur in up to 50% of patients with PsA (axPsA), causing inflammatory back pain, stiffness and changes on imaging. Whether axial SpA (axSpA) with psoriasis represents a distinct entity than axPsA is a matter of debate, since similarities and differences have been reported in terms of clinical expression and imaging. Patients with radiographically axPsA show lower prevalence of inflammatory b ack pain, lumbar and buttock pain in comparison with axSpA. In addition, imaging features differ between axPsA and axSpA, with less sacroiliitis in axPsA and more asymmetrical, chunky syndesmophytes which are predominant at the cervical spine location. Data on treatment efficacy and management recommendations are extrapolated from studies on axSpA, and only one published randomized clinical trial is dedicated specifically to axPsA to date."
36348684,"Introduction: Most sacroiliac joint (SIJ) disorders are conservatively treated; however, patients with severe pain occasionally require SIJ arthrodesis after failure of continuous conservative management for more than 6 months. We investigated the incidences of preoperative tenderness in the sacrotuberous ligament (STL) and postoperative lower-buttock pain originating from the STL to determine the best way to manage these symptoms to achieve good outcomes. (1) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent SIJ arthrodesis for SIJ disorders between January 2010 and December 2016."
33559550,"Aggressive angiomyxoma is a rare mesenchymal tumour, primarily arising in the soft tissue of the pelvis and perineum in women of reproductive age. There is a paucity of evidence on optimal management because of the rarity of these tumours, but the consensus has been for surgical excision. We present the case of a 65-year-old woman who was admitted with left-sided buttock pain and initially diagnosed with a perianal abscess. She underwent examination under anaesthesia rectum with surgical excision of the lesion, subsequent histopathological and immunochemical analysis was suggestive of aggressive angiomyxoma. To complement our case report, we also present a literature review focusing on aggressive angiomyxoma in the ischioanal fossa (also known as the ischiorectal fossa) with only eight cases of primary aggressive angiomyxoma involving the ischioanal fossa documented to date. The primary aims of this case report and literature review are to familiarise clinicians with the clinical, histopathological and immunochemical features of these tumours, and to increase appreciation that despite the rarity of aggressive angiomyxoma, it might be considered in the differential diagnosis of ischioanal lesions."

36288600,Background: Paravertebral cluneal nerves are constrained within a tunnel consisting of the thoracolumbar fascia and the iliac crest's superior rim as they pass over the iliac crest. Their involvement in low back pain has not been presented previously. (1) We hypothesized that paravertebral cluneal nerves are involved in low back pain. (2) We aimed to determine the prevalence of paravertebral cluneal nerves in the thoracolumbar fascia and the iliac crest's superior rim in patients with low back pain.
31421680,"Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between radiographic measurement in lumbar spine and clinical information including symptoms or results of functional testing using a baseline data of longitudinal cohort study. (1) Methods: The study was a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study. (2) Results: The mean age of the patients was 52.3 ± 12.6 years. (range, 18-85 years). (3) The mean follow-up period was 41.9 ± 33.7 months (range, 12-120 months)."
33891508,"Objective: In recent years, there has been an increase in research on the therapeutic effects of exergaming, but there have been few studies on these types of interventions for chronic low back pain. In this study, we hypothesized that the Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure (RFA) exergame would be effective for patients with chronic low back pain, and we conducted a randomized prospective longitudinal study. Materials and Methods: Patients with chronic low back pain were included in this study. Twenty randomly selected patients (9 males and 11 females, mean age 49.3 years) were included in the RFA group, and RFA exergaming was performed once a week for 40 minutes for 8 weeks. Twenty patients (12 males and 8 females, mean age 55.60 years) served as the control group and received oral treatment for 8 weeks. Pain and psychological scores (pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia) were measured and analyzed before and after 8 weeks of treatment in both groups. Results: In the RFA group, low back pain, buttock pain, and pain self-efficacy were significantly improved after 8 weeks of RFA exergaming, but there was no significant improvement in lower limb numbness, pain catastrophizing, or kinesiophobia. In the control group, no significant improvement was observed after 8 weeks of oral treatment. Conclusion: RFA exergaming increased pain self-efficacy and reduced pain in patients with chronic low back pain. Future treatment protocols should be developed to improve pain self-efficacy.

35284148,"Background: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) comprise a group of haematologic malignancies with different histologic subtypes. The clinical picture varies from indolent to aggressive presentation and nodal (lymphadenopathy) to extranodal (central nervous system, gastrointestinal, cutaneous plaque, or ulcer) involvement. Digital gangrene is seldom reported. Here, we describe a patient with pain and blackening of all fingers and toes as presenting symptoms of NHL. Case Presentation. A 32-year-old male weaver had been smoking three to five cannabis-containing cigarettes daily for about ten years and methamphetamine four to five tablets daily for five years. He had no history of Raynaud's phenomenon, fever, cough, weight loss, skin rash, joint pain, and atherogenic or thrombogenic risk factors. We found normal blood pressure and absent peripheral pulses in arms and legs, dry gangrene of all fingers and toes, generalized lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly with ascites. The chest X-ray was normal, as were blood sugar, lipid profile, and hepatic and renal function. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear and antiphospholipid antibodies, C-ANCA and P-ANCA, hepatitis B and C, and HIV were negative. CT abdomen revealed hepatosplenomegaly with multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies. The peripheral angiogram showed 90-99% stenosis of radial and dorsalis pedis arteries with normal proximal vessels. Diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was confirmed by histopathology of cervical lymph node (diffuse type), immunohistochemically subtyped as peripheral T cell lymphoma (not otherwise specified). The digital ischemia worsened despite cessation of cannabis and methamphetamine and starting CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) treatment, making amputation necessary."
30455493,Background: Pelvic organ prolapse includes descent of anterior / posterior wall and apical (vault) prolapse with significant morbidity. In this study we evaluated the outcome of sacrospinous ligament fixation of vault through vaginal approach as part of the repair for massive uterovaginal (pelvic organ prolapse stage III and stage IV) and vault prolapse. (1) Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent sacrospinous ligament fixation of vault through vaginal approach for massive uterovaginal and vault prolapse.
35402154,"Background: Osteo-articular Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the ischial tuberosity is a rare cause of gluteal pain. (1) We report a case of osteo-articular Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the ischial tuberosity in a patient with a history of tuberculosis of the spine. (2) Case presentation: A 50-year-old man presented with a history of low back pain and gluteal pain for 2 years. (3) Physical examination revealed a tender, fixed, and painful mass in the left gluteal region."
35772982,"Background: The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is affected in 14% to 22% in individuals presenting with chronic low back or buttock pain. This percentage is even higher in patients who underwent lumbar fusion surgery: 32% to 42%. Currently, there is no standard treatment or surgical indication for SIJ dysfunction. When patients do not respond well to nonsurgical treatment, minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion (MISJF) seems to be a reasonable option. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the current literature on the effectiveness of MISJF compared to conservative management in patients with SIJ dysfunction."
32390565,Introduction: Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is an established treatment for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia in skeletally mature individuals without arthritis. Pelvic nonunion and associated stress fractures are under-reported. Nonunited stress fractures can cause continued buttock pain and pelvic instability. The aim of this study is to report on our experience managing patients with ongoing pain following nonunion of PAO. (1) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who underwent PAO for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia between January 2010 and December 2015.

36086984,"Nerve root compression in lumbar spine may be associated with low back pain. However, isolated gluteal pain without any radicular symptoms in patient with lateral recess stenosis is rather unexpected and to our knowledge was not reported in the literature. (1) We report a case of isolated gluteal pain in a patient with lumbar spine stenosis. (2) A 55-year-old man presented with low back pain and gluteal pain without any radicular symptoms. (3) Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 level."
31155167,"External iliac artery endofibrosis is an uncommon, nonatherosclerotic disease seen in endurance cyclists. It is poorly identified by providers. These otherwise healthy patients usually present with symptoms of arterial insufficiency, such as thigh or buttock pain, loss of power, or weakness occurring during strenuous exercises. These symptoms subside rapidly with rest. As these patients lack traditional risk factors of peripheral artery disease, their symptoms are often overlooked or are attributed to other etiologies, resulting in mismanagement and delayed treatment. In this case study, we report our experience with the successful management of a 48-year-old male who is a longstanding, avid cyclist. He self-referred to our institution after extensive research of providers familiar with his problem and at the recommendation of other cyclists with similar experiences. The patient underwent a successful left external iliac to common femoral artery endarterectomy and patch angioplasty. Three months after operation, he returned to cycling and, for the most part, has remained without symptoms."
33742649,"Cellulitis and abscess are common skin infections in military populations. Although complications of necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) such as Fournier Gangrene (FG) are rare, they are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Laboratory and radiological studies may aid in the evaluation of NSTI; however, focus should remain on physical examination and prompt surgical consultation, as these infections can spread rapidly with significant increases in mortality with delayed management. We present the case of a 37-year-old male soldier with reported history of two distant left inguinal hernia repairs, complaining of increasing buttock pain despite outpatient antibiotic therapy for perineal cellulitis from his primary clinician. Despite normal vital signs and low risk from established NSTI calculator scores, examination revealed crepitus and severe tenderness extending from the buttock through the perineum and scrotum characteristic of FG. Preoperative computed tomography found additional spread of subcutaneous air from these areas into the lower abdomen, likely facilitated by the previously repaired left inguinal hernia. Surgical management necessitated debridement, multiple washouts, and ileostomy. Follow-up evaluations revealed previously undiagnosed Crohn's disease with fistula-in-ano as the inciting factor."
37583858,"Background: Subarachnoid-pleural fistula (SPF) is a complex and rare condition characterized by a pathological shunt between the subarachnoid and pleural spaces. It can lead to the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the pleural space, pneumocephalus, and the development of central nervous system infection. Trauma or thoracic spinal surgery are common causes of SPF, with symptoms including postural headache, consciousness status changes, and dyspnea. The combination of SPF and subdural hygroma is a severe and rare condition, with little existing literature on its clinical correlation."
34703300,Background: Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pathology is a cause of low back pain that may be difficult to diagnose and challenging to treat. Open and minimally invasive (MI) lateral approach fusions have been used to treat sacroiliitis over the past two decades. A novel MI posterior approach SIJ fusion technique utilizes a posteriorly placed transfixing device with single point S1 / S2 level or mid-segment SIJ fixation (LinQ procedure). Current efficacy and safety data for this novel procedure are lacking.
31340948,"Polymyalgia rheumatism and fibromyalgia are clinically similar. As there are no specific diagnostic markers, they are difficult to distinguish. A 92-year-old woman with a 3-month history of general pain, including left hip pain, was referred to our hospital. Her medical history included polymyalgia rheumatism that had been treated with prednisolone for 18 years. We found 14 of 18 symmetrical tender points. We diagnosed fibromyalgia based on two physical examinations and her personal history of general pain. Pregabalin was prescribed, and her pain gradually disappeared. About a month later, she complained of returned buttock pain and fever. She was diagnosed with exacerbation of polymyalgia rheumatism by various examinations and was treated with prednisolone. We found 3 of 18 asymmetrical tender points. No symptoms had recurred at the 1-month follow-up visit. Her case provides an opportunity to highlight the possible pitfalls when diagnosing geriatric general pain."
36923606,"Background: Multiple risk factors for recurrent lumbosacral disc herniation (rLDH) have been evaluated. However, it has been difficult to establish a consensus due to conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the predictors of reoperation in Hispanic-Americans with rLDH following primary hemilaminectomy and discectomy surgery. (1) Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed. (1) Results: A total of 524 patients were included in the study."
34391238,"Background: Endometriosis is one of the most widespread gynecological disorders and a very common condition amongst fertile women, thus it has to be considered one of the possible sources of lumbopelvic pain. Endometriosis is commonly related to low back pain (LBP) and therefore often mistaken for a musculoskeletal disorder. The purpose of this case report is to underline the primary role of clinical reasoning and assessment process, which led the physiotherapist to the differential diagnosis, considering endometriosis among the possible causes of low back pain."
34980976,"Pudendal neuralgia is a form of chronic pelvic pain, although the validity of this diagnosis has not been firmly established. It is characterized by unilateral pain in the pudendal nerve dermatome, mostly while sitting. In this case report, a 76-year-old female patient presented to her general practitioner with a 10-year history of unilateral buttock pain, which had been diagnosed as pudendal neuralgia. She tried various treatments and visited numerous specialists, but there was little improvement overall. Some medications seemed to have a positive effect, but pain ultimately persisted until psychological factors were appropriately addressed. Management of pudendal neuralgia follows general chronic neuralgia principles, from medication over nerve block to definitive surgery. However, this case serves as a prime example of how the psychosocial approach is equally important. Given that psychological factors can make pain persist, it is imperative to properly address them. As pudendal neuralgia is uncommonly encountered in primary care, specific attention must be paid to psychological factors, which become significantly more important in long-standing chronic pelvic pain."
34813438,"Introduction: Acute bacterial prostatitis is characterized by acute inflammation of the prostate gland accompanied by the presence of pain and other urinary tract or systemic symptoms. Prostatitis is a relatively common disease of the urinary tract in men, However, this case reports a man diagnosed with acute bacterial prostatitis with an unusual presentation, as well as an unusual pathogen and a unique mechanism of colonization. (1) We present a case of acute bacterial prostatitis with a unique presentation and a unique mechanism of colonization."
35103175,"Osteomyelitis commonly involves the long bones, with pelvic involvement uncommon. We report the case of a 50-year-old male who, following a bone marrow biopsy that diagnosed him with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, had persistent complaints of fever, swelling, and pain over the biopsy site. Pus cultures revealed growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis revealing features of osteomyelitis of the right ilium. He was managed conservatively with antibiotics. On the last follow-up, he had just recovered from another flare of the infection. Bone marrow biopsy is a common tool in the hematologist's inventory. It is quite safe, with complications reported in less than 0.1% of all cases. Osteomyelitis of the pelvis following this is exceedingly rare; to our knowledge, only two prior such cases have been reported. Pelvic osteomyelitis is characterized by poorly defined hip pain, limited range of motion, and difficulty with ambulation. In case of intractable hip or buttock pain following a bone marrow biopsy, osteomyelitis of the pelvis must be considered in the differential diagnosis, and appropriate management must be begun. A multidisciplinary approach is required, with surgical debridement and appropriate antibiotics."
32011555,"Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is an integral part of pediatric emergency medicine. One evolving use of POCUS is in the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections. Point-of-care ultrasound can be used to identify clinically occult infections and can be used to guide percutaneous drainage of both superficial and deep abscesses. Here, we present a case where POCUS- and US-guided needle aspiration had a significant impact on patient care by providing rapid diagnosis, as well as expediting microbiological speciation in a young male presenting with left-sided back and buttock pain."
36707831,"Background: To objectively assess the safety, feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) versus conventional vaginal (CV) surgery for sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF). (1) Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify all studies comparing vNOTES and CV surgery for SSLF. (2) Results: A total of 11 studies were included in the systematic review."
34123643,"Dengue virus infection is an arthropod-born infection with high global prevalence. A spectrum of clinical syndromes and complications were recognized following dengue fever that can range from undifferentiated fever to dengue shock syndrome. Neurological complications following dengue fever can extend to various sequelae, including transverse myelitis. We report a 20-year-old pregnant woman with a recent diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) at the period of amenorrhea (POA) of 28 weeks, presenting with left-sided severe buttock pain. Following extensive investigations, we found left-sided sacroiliitis to be the cause of the buttock pain. She completely recovered with appropriate management."

37362469,"In this study, we discuss a case of a 59-year-old male who developed a periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) three months after a total hip arthroplasty (THA). The patient complained of groin and buttock pain, swelling, and high temperature. A palpable fluid collection, discomfort, edema, and elevated local temperature were present in the clinical examination. Laboratory analysis revealed elevated white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The preoperative joint aspiration came up positive for Staphylococcus caprae (S. caprae) infection. Diagnosis and pathogen identification were confirmed by histological examination of six tissue samples obtained during surgery. We initially performed early debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) followed by antibiotic therapy suggested by an infectious disease specialist. DAIR failed two months later, and we proceeded to a two-stage revision. Following surgery, the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotic combination therapy for three weeks and thereafter with oral antibiotics for three months. Four months down the line, the patient is free of symptoms, and the inflammatory markers are normal. Finally, we will proceed with the second stage of revision. This study highlights a very rare case of PJI infection by S. caprae, reviews the limited literature, and provides the available evidence for surgical and antibiotic management."
