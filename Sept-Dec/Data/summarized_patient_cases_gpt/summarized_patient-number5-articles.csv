32358144,"Vocal fold paralysis (VFP) is an important cause of respiratory and feeding compromise in infants. The causes of neonatal VFP are varied and include central nervous system disorders, birth-related trauma, mediastinal masses, iatrogenic injuries, and idiopathic cases. Bilateral VFP often presents with stridor or respiratory distress and can require rapid intervention to stabilize an adequate airway. Unilateral VFP presents more subtly with a weak cry, swallowing dysfunction, and less frequently respiratory distress. The etiology and type of VFP is important for management. Evaluation involves direct visualization of the vocal folds, with additional imaging and testing in select cases. Swallowing dysfunction, also known as dysphagia, is very common in infants with VFP. A clinical assessment of swallowing function is necessary in all cases of VFP, with some patients also requiring an instrumental swallow assessment. Modification of feeding techniques and enteral access for feedings may be necessary. Airway management can vary from close monitoring to noninvasive ventilation, tracheostomy, and laryngeal surgery. Long-term follow-up with otolaryngology and speech-language pathology service is necessary for all children with VFP to ensure adequate breathing, swallowing, and phonation. The short- and long-term health and quality-of-life consequences of VFP can be substantial, especially if not managed early."
29939533,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a term used to describe pneumonia (lung infection) that develops in a patient who has been on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the second most common hospital-acquired infection among pediatrics and neonatal intensive care unit patients. It accounts for 7% to 32% of healthcare-associated infections and 10% of all pediatric device-related infections reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Generally, the rate of pneumonia in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) is lower than in adult intensive care units (ICU). In neonates, the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia is inversely proportional to birth weight. There is limited data on infants and children with VAP, so most of the information is extrapolated from adult studies."
29261912,"Acute respiratory failure is caused by a wide range of etiologies. Progression to cardiopulmonary arrest and ultimately death is likely in the absence of effective and timely airway management. Therefore, one of the primary goals of airway management is to provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation to avoid or halt the progression to cardiopulmonary arrest. Effective and timely airway management is also an essential component of successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Airway management is critical in the pediatric population as pediatric airway problems are commonly seen in pediatric and general emergency departments. Respiratory distress is the fourth most common chief complaint in children presenting to the emergency department."
34215399,"Anatomically, the airway is ever changing in size, anteroposterior alignment, and point of most narrow dimension. Special considerations regarding obesity, chronic and acute illness, underlying developmental abnormalities, and age can all affect preparation and intervention toward securing a definitive airway. Mechanical ventilation strategies should focus on limiting peak inspiratory pressures and optimizing lung protective tidal volumes. Emergency physicians should work toward minimizing risk of peri-intubation hypoxemia and arrest. With review of anatomic and physiologic principles in the setting of a practical approach toward evaluating and managing distress and failure, emergency physicians can successfully manage critical pediatric airway encounters."
36806432,"Background: Airway foreign body can be a life-threatening issue in pediatric and adult patients, and the majority of these patients will first present to the emergency department. (1) The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of airway foreign bodies in children and adults. (2) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital between January 2010 and December 2016. (3) Results: A total of 524 patients were included in the study."
35001832,"The unique challenges of pediatric respiratory and airway emergencies require the development and maintenance of a prehospital quality management program that includes pediatric-focused medical oversight and clinical care expertise, data collection, operational considerations, focused education, and clinician competency evaluation.NAEMSP recommends: Medical director oversight must include a focus on pediatric airway and respiratory management and integrate pediatric-specific elements in guideline development, competency assessment, and skills maintenance efforts.EMS agencies are encouraged to collaborate with medical professionals who have expertise in pediatric emergency care to provide support for quality management initiatives in pediatric respiratory distress and airway management.EMS agencies should define quality indicators for pediatric-specific elements in respiratory distress and airway management and benchmark performance based on regional and national standards.EMS agencies should implement both quantitative (objective) and qualitative (subjective) measures of performance to assess competency in pediatric respiratory distress and airway management.EMS agencies choosing to incorporate pediatric endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway insertion must use pediatric-specific quality management benchmarks and perform focused review of advanced airway management."
34336618,"Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide. Although the majority of patients show mild symptoms, the disease can rapidly progress in severe cases and develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that may lead to therapeutic interventions, including oxygenation, tracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. It is suggested that the new coronavirus spreads mostly via droplets, surface contact, and natural aerosols. Hence, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures, such as endotracheal intubation, may put the healthcare workers at a high risk of infection. In the course of managing patients with COVID-19, it is essential to prioritize the safety of healthcare workers. Hence, this review study aimed to summarize new guidelines and proper airway management in adult and pediatric COVID-19 patients."
32580323,"There have been significant advancements in the safe delivery of anesthesia as well as improvements in surgical technique; however, the perioperative period can still be high risk for the pediatric patient. Perioperative respiratory complications (PRCs) are some of the most common critical events that can occur in pediatric surgical patients and they can lead to increased length of hospitalization, worsened patient outcomes, and higher hospital and postoperative costs. It is important to determine the various factors that put pediatric patients at increased risk of PRCs. This will allow for more detailed and accurate informed consent, optimized perioperative management strategy, improved allocation of clinical resources, and, hopefully, better patient experience. There are only a few risk prediction models / scoring tools developed for and validated in the pediatric patient population, but they have been useful in helping identify the key factors associated with a high likelihood of developing PRCs. Some of these factors are patient factors, while others are procedure-related factors. Some of these factors may be modified such that the patient's clinical status is optimized preoperatively to decrease the risk of PRCs occurring perioperatively. Fore knowledge of the factors that are not able to be modified can help guide allocation of perioperative clinical resources such that the negative impact of these non-modifiable factors is buffered. Additional training in pediatric anesthesia or focused expertise in pediatric airway management, vascular access and management of massive hemorrhage should be considered for the perioperative management of the less than 3 age group. Intraoperative ventilation strategy plays a key role in determining respiratory outcomes for both adult and pediatric surgical patients. Key components of lung protective mechanical ventilation strategy such as low tidal volume and moderate PEEP used in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in pediatric intensive care units have been adopted in pediatric operating rooms. Adequate post-operative analgesia that balances pain control with appropriate mental status and respiratory drive is important in reducing PRCs."
37565058,"Objective: To perform a scoping review to characterize postoperative outcomes of pediatric patients (ages 0-18) with a history of congenital head and neck teratomas. (1) Methods: A systematic search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. (2) Results: A total of 13 studies were included in the review. (1) Conclusion: The literature suggests that patients with a history of congenital head and neck teratomas have a higher risk of postoperative complications and longer hospital stays."
35001823,"Devices and techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, supraglottic airway devices, and noninvasive ventilation offer important tools for airway management in critically ill EMS patients. Over the past decade the tools, technology, and strategies used to assess and manage pediatric respiratory and airway emergencies have evolved, and evidence regarding their use continues to grow.NAEMSP recommends: Methods and tools used to properly size pediatric equipment for ages ranging from newborns to adolescents should be available to all EMS clinicians. All pediatric equipment should be routinely checked and clearly identifiable in EMS equipment supply bags and vehicles.EMS agencies should train and equip their clinicians with age-appropriate pulse oximetry and capnography equipment to aid in the assessment and management of pediatric respiratory distress and airway emergencies.EMS agencies should emphasize noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and effective bag-valve-mask ventilation strategies in children.Supraglottic airways can be used as primary or secondary airway management interventions for pediatric respiratory failure and cardiac arrest in the EMS setting.Pediatric endotracheal intubation has unclear benefit in the EMS setting. Advanced approaches to pediatric ETI including drug-assisted airway management, apneic oxygenation, and use of direct and video laryngoscopy require further research to more clearly define their risks and benefits prior to widespread implementation.If considering the use of pediatric endotracheal intubation, the EMS medical director must ensure the program provides pediatric-specific initial training and ongoing competency and quality management activities to ensure that EMS clinicians attain and maintain mastery of the intervention.Paramedic use of direct laryngoscopy paired with Magill forceps to facilitate foreign body removal in the pediatric patient should be maintained even when pediatric endotracheal intubation is not approved as a local clinical intervention."
34527357,"Central airway obstruction (CAO), which results from malignant, benign or iatrogenic etiologies, causes significant morbidity and mortality and can be seen in both the pediatric and adult patient population. Patients frequently present to the hospital with dyspnea, stridor, and respiratory distress, indicating impending respiratory failure. Heliox is used to help alleviate symptoms while procedural planning takes place. A multidisciplinary approach to airway management is often needed. Interventional pulmonologists treat CAO with rigid of flexible bronchoscopy in order to deliver therapeutic interventions under general anesthesia. In severe CAO where there is concern for total loss of the airway creating a life-threatening situation for the patient during procedural intervention, short term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO has been successfully reported in the literature to provide ventilation and oxygenation support throughout the procedure. Venoarterial ECMO can be used to augment cardiac output in cases of central tumors with cardiac involvement. ECMO can also be used for the removal of tracheal stents when there is a concern that ventilation will be interrupted for a prolonged period of time. ECMO has also been reported as a salvage measure for patients with life threatening hemoptysis until more definitive interventions can be performed. Short term ECMO cannulation can be used with limited associated morbidity and a heparin-free approach can be pursued when there is a concern for bleeding. We will briefly review the anesthetic considerations in CAO as well as review cases of CAO where ECMO was employed to safely alleviate the airway compromise."
34458951,"The global spread of COVID-19 has imparted significant economic, medical, and social burdens. Like adults, children are affected by this pandemic. However, milder clinical symptoms are often experienced by them. Only a minimal proportion of the affected patients may develop severe and complicated COVID-19. Supportive treatment is recommended in all patients. Antiviral and immunomodulatory medications are spared for hospitalized children with respiratory distress or severe to critical disease. Up till now, remdesivir is the only USFDA-approved anti-COVID-19 medication indicated in the majority of symptomatic patients with moderate to severe disease. Dexamethasone is solely recommended in patients with respiratory distress maintained on oxygen or ventilatory support. The use of these medications in pediatric patients is founded on evidence deriving from adult studies. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving pediatric COVID-19 patients have assessed these medications' efficacy and safety, among others. Similarly, three novel monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies, bamlanivimab, casirivimab and imdevimab, have been recently authorized by the USFDA. Nonetheless, their efficacy has not been demonstrated by multiple RCTs. In this review, we aim to dissect the various potential therapeutics used in children with COVID-19. We aspire to provide a comprehensive review of the available evidence and display the mechanisms of action and the pharmacokinetic properties of the studied therapeutics. Our review offers an efficient and practical guide for treating children with COVID-19."
35001818,"Although pediatric airway and respiratory emergencies represent high-acuity situations, the ability of EMS clinicians to effectively manage these patients is hampered by infrequent clinical exposure and shortcomings in pediatric-specific education. Cognitive gaps in EMS clinicians' understanding of the differences between pediatric and adult airway anatomy and respiratory physiology and pathology, variability in the training provided to EMS clinicians, and decay of the psychomotor skills necessary to safely and effectively manage pediatric patients experiencing respiratory emergencies collectively pose significant threats to the quality and safety of care delivered to pediatric patients. NAEMSP recommends: Pediatric airway education should include discussion of the factors that make pediatric airway management challenging.EMS agencies should provide pediatric-specific education that addresses recognition and treatment of pediatric respiratory distress based upon pathophysiology affecting upper airways, lower airways, cardiovascular systems, or extrinsic causes of disordered breathing. Pediatric airway training should also differentiate between hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Education should emphasize that the cognitive and psychomotor skills requisite in management of pediatric respiratory emergencies will differ across patient age groups.EMS clinicians should be provided education and training in technology-dependent children and children and youth with special health care needs.EMS clinicians should receive initial and ongoing education and training in pediatric airway and respiratory conditions that emphasizes the principle of using the least invasive most effective strategies to achieve oxygenation and ventilation.Initial and continuing pediatric-focused education should be structured to maintain EMS clinician competency in the assessment and management of pediatric airway and respiratory emergencies and should be provided on a recurring basis to mitigate the decay of EMS clinicians' knowledge and skills that occurs due to infrequent field-based clinical exposure.Integration of clinician education programs with quality management programs is essential for the development and delivery of initial and continuing education intended to help EMS clinicians attain and maintain proficiency in pediatric airway and respiratory management."
36973036,"Background: Noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) is widely used in pediatric ICUs (PICUs). However, there is limited experience regarding the utilization of NRS in non-PICU settings. We aimed to evaluate the success rate of NRS in pediatric high-dependency units (PHDUs), identify predictors of NRS failure, quantify adverse events, and assess outcomes. (1) Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to a PICU between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017, who received NRS."
34900629,"Background: Acute bronchiolitis is the most frequent cause of respiratory distress in pediatric emergency medicine. The risk of respiratory failure is frequently over evaluated, and results in systematic vascular access. (1) The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of respiratory failure in children with bronchiolitis and to identify the factors associated with respiratory failure. (2) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of children aged 0-18 years with bronchiolitis admitted to the pediatric emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in the Netherlands between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015."
31164485,"Background: Chest physiotherapy has been reported to be beneficial in specific clinical contexts, yet it carries a risk of potential serious adverse events with little benefit in other patients. Therefore, identifying and limiting airway clearance therapies to patients with the greatest potential benefit and least risk is clinically relevant and important. This study aims to validate the Airway Clearance and Expansion Index (ACE-I) for the serial assessment of hospitalized pediatric patients with impaired airway clearance and to establish reliability in score acquisition across a range of pediatric respiratory disease states."
31088891,"Rapid response teams have become necessary components of patient care within the hospital community, including for airway management. Pediatric patients with an increased risk of having a difficult airway emergency can often be predicted on the basis of clinical scenarios and medical history. This predictability has led to the creation of airway consultation services designed to develop airway management plans for patients experiencing respiratory distress and who are at risk for having a difficult airway requiring advanced airway management. In addition, evolving technology has facilitated airway management outside of the operating suite. Training and continuing education on the use of these tools for airway management is imperative for clinicians responding to airway emergencies. We describe the comprehensive multidisciplinary, multicomponent Pediatric Difficult Airway Program we created that addresses each component identified above: the Pediatric Difficult Airway Response Team (PDART), the Pediatric Difficult Airway Consult Service, and the pediatric educational airway program. Approximately 41% of our PDART emergency calls occurred in the evening hours, requiring a specialized team ready to respond throughout the day and night. A multitude of devices were used during the calls, obviating the need for formal education and hands-on experience with these devices. Lastly, we observed that the majority of PDART calls occurred in patients who either were previously designated as having a difficult airway and / or had anatomic variations that suggest challenges during airway management. By instituting the Pediatric Difficult Airway Consult Service, we have decreased emergent Difficult Airway Response Team calls with the ultimate goal of first-attempt intubation success."
32674886,Background: Tracheobronchial injuries are rare but feasibly life-threatening conditions. A prompt diagnosis and early management can be lifesaving. Due to the unspecific symptoms and indirect radiological signs the diagnosis often delays. (1). (2). (3).). (4).). (5.). (6.). (7.). (8.). (9.). (10.).
37465711,Audience and type of curriculum: This is a refresher curriculum utilizing multiple methods of education to augment the skills of generalist healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the identification and stabilization of pediatric respiratory emergencies. Our audience of implementation was Belizean generalist providers. (1) We used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact of the intervention. (2) We used a pre- and post-intervention survey to assess the impact of the intervention on the knowledge and skills of the participants.
33902222,"Objective: To explore the risk factors for mortality in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Methods: Clinical data of 109 patients with severe PARDS supported by ECMO, who were hospitalized in 6 ECMO centers in China from September 2012 to February 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into survival group and death group according to the prognosis. Chi-square test and rank sum test were used to compare the variables between the two groups, including the demographic data, laboratory examination results, clinical data before and after ECMO, and other supportive treatment. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression models were used to analyze the prognostic risk factors. Results: In these 109 cases, 54 died and 55 survived. Compared with the survival group, the death group had higher incidences of acute kidney injury (AKI) (48.1% (26 / 54) vs. 21.8% (12 / 55), χ ² = 8.318, P = 0.004) and coagulation dysfunction (22.2% (12 / 54) vs. 7.3% (4 / 55), χ ² = 4.862, P = 0.027), and higher rate of renal replacement therapy (48.1% (26 / 54) vs. 21.8% (12 / 55), χ ² = 9.694, P = 0.008) during ECMO support. Logistic regression analysis showed that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and AKI were independent risk factors for death in patients with severe PARDS requiring ECMO support (HR = 3.88,95% CI 1.04-14.52, HR = 4.84,95% CI 1.21-19.46, both P < 0.05). Conclusion: AKI and CRRT are independent risk factors for predicting mortality in patients with severe PARDS requiring ECMO support."
34395044,"Pulmonary artery sling is a rare congenital vascular abnormality, where the left pulmonary artery originates from the right pulmonary artery, passes between trachea, and esophagus and reaching the left hilum. Cough, wheezing, and difficulty in feeding are three major symptoms. Untreated pulmonary sling carries high morbidity and mortality, most of which is due to the airway and other associated anomalies. Herein, we reported a 40-day-old male infant who admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with progressive respiratory distress and diagnosed with left pulmonary sling with tracheal stenosis. We discussed the diagnosis and management of pulmonary artery sling and present the successful use of laryngeal mask in difficult airway management."
30890631,"Background: All health-care providers who care for infants and children should be able to effectively provide ventilation with a bag and a mask. Respiratory therapists (RTs'), as part of rapid response teams, need to quickly identify the need for airway support and use adjunct airway interventions when subjects are difficult to mask ventilate. Before implementation of an educational curriculum for airway management, we assessed whether pediatric RTs' who enter the room of a simulated infant mannequin in severe respiratory distress are able to apply bag-mask ventilation within 60 s and implement 2 adjunct airway maneuvers in a patient who is difficult to ventilate."
31218294,"Objective: Strategies to improve traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes in India are ill defined. The objective of this study was to examine baseline prehospital (PH) factors associated with outcomes from the Andhra Pradesh Traumatic Brain Injury Project. (APTIBP). (1) Methods: This was a prospective, observational study of patients with TBI admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Andhra Pradesh, India. (2) Results: Of the 601 patients, the median age was 32 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 25-40), and 50.5% were male."
36112265,"Objectives: To demonstrate the clinical profile, management options, and outcomes of children with stage 4S neuroblastoma (NB 4S) diagnosed at a tertiary care center in a resource-challenged nation. The authors also intend to highlight the factors associated with an unfavorable prognosis in this series of patients. (1) Methods: This is a retrospective study of children with NB 4S diagnosed at the authors' institution from January 2000 to December 2015. (2) Results: A total of 25 patients were included in the study."
30232661,"Background: Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (pARDS) is a rare but very severe condition. Management of the condition remains a major challenge for pediatric intensive care specialists. (1) The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of children with pARDS admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). (2) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of children admitted to a PICU with a diagnosis of pARDS between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015."
36527981,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent cause of disability and death in the pediatric population, often requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Patients with significant TBI or intracranial hemorrhage require advanced airway management to protect against aspiration, hypoxia, and hypercarbia, eventually necessitating tracheostomy. While tracheostomy is much less common in children compared to adults, its prevalence among pediatric populations has been steadily increasing. Although early tracheostomy has demonstrated improved outcomes in adult patients, optimal tracheostomy timing in the pediatric population with TBI remains to be definitively established."
30554695,"Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and the outcomes for step-down (SD) unit admission as an alternative to intensive care unit (ICU) admission after supraglottoplasty in the pediatric patient. (1) Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent supraglottoplasty at our institution from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015. (2) Results: A total of 21 patients were identified. (1) Conclusion: SD unit admission after supraglottoplasty is a safe and feasible alternative to ICU admission in the pediatric patient."
35104018,"Aluminum phosphide (AIP) is a fumigant commonly used in agricultural areas. AIP is frequently misused for suicidal purposes because it is easily accessible. AIP poisoning causes severe metabolic acidosis, resistant hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure with cardiogenic shock. Despite supportive management and intensive care, most patients die following AIP ingestion because there is no specific antidote. In this case report we present a 15-year-old female who presented with vomiting, coma and epigastric pain. She developed resistant metabolic acidosis and hypotension due to AIP poisoning. Although supportive treatment did not result in clinical improvement, she was successfully treated with automated red blood cell exchange. Automated red blood cell exchange is a procedure which is used to exchange the patient erythrocyte mass with donor red blood cell. Although automated red blood cell exchange is a preferred treatment method in the complications of sickle cell anemia, some blood diseases and infectious diseases such as malaria and babesiosis, there is little information about its use in poisoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first child with AIP poisoning who was treated with automated red blood cell exchange."
32032028,"Influenza is a generally self-limited infection agent that only rarely causes severe complications. To increase awareness about its serious complications, we report three cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection complicated with hemolytic uremic syndrome, myocarditis and acute necrotizing encephalopathy. In all three cases, nasopharyngeal samples confirmed influenza A (H1N1) infection by antigen test and multiplex PCR detection. The first case, a 3-year-old girl, had respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure at admission, and was diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome. Supportive treatment and oseltamivir did not prevent the development of chronic renal failure. The second case, a 5-year-old girl admitted with lethargia and flu-like symtoms and was diagnosed with myocarditis and cardiogenic shock. Oseltamivir and supportive treatment including extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) failed. She died on the 3rd day of admission. The third case, a 21-month-old boy, presented with decreased level of consciousness and was diagnosed with acute necrotizing encephalopathy with the aid of cranial magnetic resonance imagining (MRI). He was discharged without any neurological sequelae three weeks after admission. It should be kept in mind that influenza virus does not always cause a self-limited flu. Multidisciplinary management, early diagnosis and antiviral treatment are critical for the disease and to prevent its life-threatening complications."
30863755,"Background: Myocarditis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, leading to long-term sequelae including chronic congestive heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart transplantation, and death. The initial diagnosis of myocarditis is usually based on clinical presentation, but this widely ranges from the severe sudden onset of a cardiogenic shock to asymptomatic patients. Early recognition is essential in order to monitor and start supportive treatment prior to the development of severe adverse events. Of note, many cases of fulminant myocarditis are usually misdiagnosed as otherwise minor conditions during the weeks before the unexpected deterioration."
35989776,"This case report documents a rare and unique presentation of an oropharyngeal duplication cyst and subsequent neonatal airway management. A one-day-old premature female presented with postpartum respiratory distress requiring emergent intubation secondary to an oropharyngeal mass of the left tongue. After being stabilized and transferred to an academic center, imaging revealed a cystic lesion that was then marsupialized and drained by the otolaryngology team. Pathology demonstrated mature colonic tissue and was consistent with an enteric duplication cyst. This report highlights the importance of prenatal diagnosis and the potential of a lifesaving ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure."
32533888,"Background: A preliminary national audit of real fasting times including 3324 children showed that the fasting times for clear fluids and light meals were frequently shorter than recommended in current guidelines, but the sample size was too small for subgroup analyses. (1) Methods: A retrospective audit of real fasting times including 3324 children aged 0-18 years was conducted in the UK. (2) Results: The median (IQR) fasting times for clear fluids and light meals were significantly shorter than recommended in the UK (clear fluids: 8 (6-10) min; light meals: 10 (8-12) min)."
34922610,"Background: Prone position ventilation is a widely used lung protection ventilation strategy. The strategy is more convenient to implement in children compared to adults. Due to the precise mechanism of improving oxygenation function, development of pediatric prone ventilation technology has been largely focused on children with acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is a paucity of high-quality studies investigating the effects of prone position ventilation after pediatric cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of prone position ventilation in infants who develop postoperative acute lung injury after surgery for congenital heart disease."
35421001,"The desmoglein 3 18q11 gene mutation has not been well described in humans, except for a few case reports. The desmoglein 3 gene controls a transmembrane component of the desmosome complex that mediates epidermal cell adhesion and integrity of the oropharyngeal mucosa. We present two fraternal twin infants who exhibited features of airway compromise and respiratory distress shortly after birth. These infants presented with chronic, cyclical sloughing of the upper airway, larynx, and pharynx associated with difficult airway management and eventual respiratory failure. It is imperative that practitioners be aware of the severity of this rare mutation."
34824924,"Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD 1) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by distal muscular atrophy and respiratory distress. It presents between six weeks and six months of age, with an eventual requirement of respiratory support. To date, no curative treatment to attenuate or stop the clinical deterioration has been found; therefore, supportive treatment is the corner stone of management. We report a 12-week-old infant with SMARD1 initially diagnosed and managed as a case of infant botulism secondary to a history of significant exposure to honey. SMARD1 and infant botulism all share characteristic clinical features, namely, respiratory distress, hypotonia, and autonomic dysfunction with typical onset of less than one year of age. This case report illustrates that SMARD1, SMA Type 1, and infant botulism share common clinical features. It is important to maintain a broad differential when evaluating an infant with hypotonia, especially when there is a lack of clinical response to conventional medical interventions directed toward the working diagnosis."
34794294,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is an exceptionally rare type of SMA. It results from disintegration of alpha motor neurons of the spinal cord. Clinically, children affected with this disorder present between the age of six weeks to six months with respiratory distress and hypotonia. Most of the children die before the age of 13 months. Here, we report a new variant in a female infant with SMARD1 having a novel IGHMBP2 gene mutation. Despite supportive treatment, she died at the age of 5 months in hospital. To the best of our knowledge, the variant has not been described in the literature so far. Key Words: Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type-1 (SMARD1), Hypotonia, respiratory distress, infants."
