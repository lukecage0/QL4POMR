31476792,"Aneurysmal bone cyst is a rare lesion that is most often found in young adults and children. It can have an unpredictable behavior, with a high recurrence rate after treatment. Treatment is based on personal and institutional experience and preferences. Standard treatment consists of curettage (manual + motorized high-speed burr) plus local adjuvants and bone grafting to fill the void. In anatomical locations that are difficult to reach surgically, percutaneous procedures (injection of sclerosant agents, radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFTA)) or selective arterial embolization (SAE) are used. Medical management with bisphosphonates (BPs) or denosumab has also been advocated. Minimally invasive surgical procedures such as ""curopsy"" and percutaneous demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and / or autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMC) grafting have also been proposed. SAE is used as a pre-operative procedure to reduce intra-operative bleeding in the case of large lesions and as primary treatment for spinal lesions. The purpose of this review is to present currently available options for the management of aneurysmal bone cyst."
33586764,"Intrinsic brain tumors often occur within functional neural networks, leading to neurological impairment and disability of varying degrees. Advances in our understanding of tumor-network integration, human cognition and language processing, and multiparametric imaging, combined with refined intraoperative tumor resection techniques, have enhanced surgical management of intrinsic brain tumors within eloquent areas. However, cognitive symptoms impacting health-related quality of life, particularly processing speed, attention, concentration, working memory, and executive function, often persist after the postoperative recovery period and treatment. Multidisciplinary cognitive rehabilitation is the standard of care for addressing cognitive impairments in many neurological diseases. There is promising research to support the use of cognitive rehabilitation in adult brain tumor patients. In this review, we summarize the history and usefulness of postacute cognitive rehabilitation for adult brain tumor patients."

31954491,"It would be impossible to summarise all of the significant developments in the surgical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), even just over the past year, in a manuscript of this scope. Thus, we have selected topics for discussion that are the subject of current controversy and have attempted to present balanced points of view. Hepatic resection and transplantation are both mature modalities, and for the most part technical advances and improvements in candidate selection are incremental. The ability to readily cure hepatitis C stands out as the most impactful development in the field over recent years, especially in Western countries where hepatitis C has long been the chief aetiology underlying HCC and a predictor of poor outcomes after surgery, but its full implications remain to be clarified. The rising incidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related HCC and what it means with regard to surgical HCC management is an area of great current interest. With advancing technology, non-surgical locoregional treatments are gaining increasing application as potentially curative therapies. In addition, the advances in molecular and genomic assessment of HCC hold promise for personalising treatment and prognostication. The possible role of immunotherapy as an adjuvant to resection is being aggressively investigated. While liver surgery maintains an important role, the care of patients with HCC is more and more a team effort and needs to take place in the context of a well-integrated interdisciplinary programme to achieve the best outcomes for patients."
30701608,"Surgical release of the lingual frenulum (frenotomy) has become an increasingly common procedure, performed from birth through to adulthood. Surprisingly, detailed anatomy of the in-situ lingual frenulum has never been described, and no anatomical basis has been proposed for the individual variability in frenulum morphology. The lingual frenulum is frequently referred to as a ""cord"" or ""submucosal band"" of connective tissue, yet there is no evidence to support this anatomical construct. This paper aims to describe the anatomy of the in-situ lingual frenulum and its relationship to floor of mouth structures. Fresh tissue microdissection of the lingual frenulum and floor of mouth was performed on nine adult cadavers with photo-documentation and description of findings. The lingual frenulum is a dynamic structure, formed by a midline fold in a layer of fascia that inserts around the inner arc of the mandible, forming a diaphragm-like structure across the floor of mouth. This fascia is located immediately beneath the oral mucosa, fusing centrally with the connective tissue on the tongue's ventral surface. The sublingual glands and submandibular ducts are enveloped by the fascial layer and anterior genioglossus fibers are suspended beneath it. Lingual nerve branches are located superficially on the ventral surface of the tongue, immediately deep to the fascia. The lingual frenulum is not a discrete midline structure. It is formed by dynamic elevation of a midline fold in the floor of mouth fascia. With this study, the clinical concept of ankyloglossia and its surgical management warrant revision. Clin.

36231143,"Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, occurring at an incidence rate of 12.9 per 100,000 in the US adult population. While the overall 10-year survival of PTC nears 95%, the presence of lymph node metastasis (LNM) or capsular invasion indicates the need for extensive neck dissection with possible adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy. While imaging modalities such as ultrasound and CT are currently in use for the detection of suspicious cervical lymph nodes, their sensitivities for tumor-positive nodes are low. Therefore, advancements in preoperative detection of LNM may optimize the surgical and medical management of patients with thyroid cancer. To this end, we analyzed bulk RNA-sequencing datasets to identify candidate markers highly predictive of LNM. We identified MEG3, a long-noncoding RNA previously described as a tumor suppressor when expressed in malignant cells, as highly associated with LNM tissue. Furthermore, the expression of MEG3 was highly predictive of tumor infiltration with cancer-associated fibroblasts, and single-cell RNA-sequencing data revealed the expression of MEG3 was isolated to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the most aggressive form of thyroid cancers. Our findings suggest that MEG3 expression, specifically in CAFs, is highly associated with LNM and may be a driver of aggressive disease."
31080117,"Retrorectal tumors (RRT), whether benign or malignant in nature, are rare in adults and often asymptomatic. While diagnosis is based on clinical findings, differential diagnosis depends mainly on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI provides guidance for surgical management, the first-line treatment of choice. Four surgical approaches are described: abdominal, perineal, posterior and abdomino-sacral.. This review of major reported series has made it possible to specify the indications for each surgical approach, as well as the advantages, disadvantages and complications of each one. The choice of surgical approach is determined by the nature of the RRT, its anatomical position relative to the middle of the third sacral vertebra (S3) and the presence or absence of invasion of the neighboring organs, the pelvis or sacral vertebrae. The abdominal route is chosen for tumors situated above the middle of S3, whether benign or malignant, but without invasion of neighboring organs. The perineal route is indicated for benign RRT situated below the middle of S3. The posterior route is chosen for tumors located below the middle of S3, and allows an associated resection of sacral segments in case of tumor invasion. The combined abdomino-sacral route is indicated for RRT above the middle of S3, when there is an invasion of a pelvic organ or a sacral vertebra. Intra- and post-operative complications are mainly hemorrhagic, neurological and infectious. The long-term prognosis is usually favorable, but varies according to the nature of the RRT and its management."
35467767,"Vascular tumors and malformations present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to many physicians. Because these lesions are rare, few surgeons have enough experience with them other than those practicing in tertiary vascular anomaly treatment centers. Some patients may have been misdiagnosed or mistreated during childhood and present in adult age with either recurrence or with an untreated lesion. Ideally, a multidisciplinary treatment team should be involved to discuss management with the patient including specialists in surgery, interventional radiology, pathology, hematology, genetics, and dermatology. As our understanding of the pathogenesis of these lesions grows, novel therapies are being employed which may decrease the need for surgery. Nevertheless, some lesions need definitive treatment with surgery. Improving understanding of the surgical management of vascular anomalies will improve cosmetic and functional outcomes for patients."
30924056,"Although melanoma is a rare diagnosis in the pediatric population, advances in the management of adults with melanoma offer the prospect of promising therapeutic options for children. At this time, medical management is not considered curative but may reduce the risk of recurrence or prolong survival. Surgical management remains the mainstay of treatment. Medical therapy of pediatric melanoma is not thought to have a role for in situ, early-stage, or localized disease, but adjuvant therapy may have a role in improving the prognosis of patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), spread beyond the regional lymph node basin, metastatic disease, or recurrent disease. Medical treatment options include immunotherapies, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted therapies, which have provided improved toxicity profiles compared with traditional chemotherapy regimens in the setting of advanced disease. There is a growing body of pediatric-specific data relevant to the use of adjuvant therapies for advanced melanoma in children."
33406375,"Patients with foot pain commonly present to their primary care physicians for their initial management and treatment. These patients and their respective foot or lesser toe pain can present the physician with a complex problem with a long differential list. Depending on the timing of the pain and underlying pathology, these differentials can be divided into acute and acute exacerbation of chronic conditions. This review categorizes the history, physical exam, radiological findings, conservative treatment, and surgical management for each major cause of lesser toe pain, whether acute or chronic. The acute conditions surrounding lesser toe pain in the adult population discussed are toe fractures, toe dislocations, and metatarsal head and neck fractures. The chronic pathologies surrounding lesser toe pain in the adult population evaluated in this review include metatarsalgia, Morton's neuroma, Freiberg infraction, brachymetatarsia, bunionettes, and lesser toe disorders."
33706906,"Melanoma is the most common skin cancer in children, often presenting in an atypical fashion. The incidence of melanoma in children has been declining. The mainstay of therapy is surgical resection. Sentinel lymph node biopsy often is indicated to guide therapy and determine prognosis. Completion lymph node dissection is recommended in selective cases after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. Those with advanced disease receive adjuvant systemic treatment. Because children are excluded from melanoma clinical trials, management is based on pediatric retrospective data and adult clinical trials. This review focuses on epidemiology, presentation, surgical management, adjuvant therapy, and outcomes of pediatric melanoma."
30954961,"Post-traumatic bronchobiliary fistula (BBF) is a rare entity, with only a few cases reported worldwide. Bilioptysis is pathognomonic of the condition, however, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage along with CT are used for confirmation. We describe this condition in a young woman who presented to us with bilioptysis following a laparotomy for blunt torso trauma. Diagnosis was made of BBF, followed by surgical management and complete recovery. We emphasise the signs of early diagnosis, confirmatory tests, individualised treatment and advocate surgical management as the gold standard of treatment."

34047809,"Unicuspid aortic valve (UAV) stenosis is a rare condition accounting for 5% of non-rheumatic aortic stenosis. The diagnosis can be difficult to make prior to surgical intervention and transesophageal echocardiography has been demonstrated to be more accurate in making the diagnosis compared to transthoracic echocardiography. The presence of a posteriorly located aortic orifice on the short-axis views, with one or two visible raphe anteriorly; the absence of commissures (acommissural); or the presence of a lone commissure (unicommissural) between the left and noncoronary, or the left and right cusps suggests the diagnosis. Patients with UAV are predominantly males and present with stenosis about a decade earlier than those with the more prevalent bicuspid aortic valves (BAV). They more commonly present with aortic annular dilatation and have fewer comorbidities at presentation compared to patients with BAV. Surgical management of UAV stenosis includes aortic valve replacement through standard open heart surgery or percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), aortic valve repair either by bicuspidization, tricuspidization or trileaflet reconstruction, or the Ross procedure. Patients with UAV stenosis require less concomitant coronary or other cardiac procedures when they need surgical intervention, but are about a decade younger at the time of their death. UAV stenosis is a distinct congenital anomaly with a different natural course than BAV. Surgical management should be individualized based on the patient's age at presentation, aortoannular anatomy, and associated cardiac conditions."
36322436,"Spondylodiscitis is often diagnosed late in its course because its symptoms are vague. The incidence in adults increases with age, being seen most commonly in men in their 50s and 60s, so the presence of other medical conditions or infections can make it more difficult to identify spondylodiscitis. Diagnosis is made based on clinical suspicion, raised levels of inflammatory markers, a positive blood or tissue biopsy culture and radiological findings. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, treatment must be started promptly. The mainstay of treatment is medical management, with antibiotics tailored to the relevant organism, as well as immobilisation. Where surgery is indicated, the aims are debridement of infected tissue, tissue sampling, neural decompression and stabilisation. Spondylodiscitis is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity and should be treated promptly to ensure the best outcome."
34996630,"Unicystic ameloblastoma is a distinct pathological variant with varying evidence published about its behaviour and surgical management. Due to a paucity of large studies in the literature with long-term follow up, the aim of this study was to analyse its surgical management and identify clinicopathological features associated with recurrences. All histopathologically confirmed lesions diagnosed at two referral centres between 1995 and 2020 were retrospectively analysed. Demographic, clinical, radiological, and histopathological features were analysed along with surgical methods and follow-up data. Univariate regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for recurrence. Sixty-three patients were included in the study with mean age of 26.3 years and a male to female ratio of 1: 0.75. The majority of lesions occurred in the posterior mandible (57.1%) and were unilocular (88.9%). Most lesions were managed with enucleation followed by application of Carnoy's solution (ferric chloride: 1g; chloroform: 3 mL; glacial acetic acid: 1 mL; ethyl alcohol 96%: 6 mL) and burring of the peripheral bone margin which resulted in the lowest recurrences (9.1%) besides resection. Significantly associated clinicopathological features with recurrences included patients who were male, large lesions (> 90 mm), presence of root resorption, cortical perforation, mural subtype, and retention of associated teeth. In conclusion, decision making in the management of unicystic ameloblastoma should be based on the clinicopathological features and not be solely based on the histopathological subtype. Enucleation followed by application of Carnoy's solution and burring of the peripheral bone margin was demonstrated to be the least invasive method with an acceptable low recurrence rate."
30739214,"Pathologies of pediatric brain tumors are more varied than those diagnosed in adults and survival outcomes more optimistic. Therapies for pediatric brain tumors are also diverse and treatment options are expanding. The growing number of adult survivors of childhood brain tumors is quite diverse. Medical management of these adults requires understanding the tumor diagnosis and location, the modalities used to treat the tumor, the age of the survivor at the time of diagnosis and treatment, any complications of treatment, and, most importantly, the baseline medical condition and neurological function of each adult survivor. A network of medical, neurological, and mental health providers is critical in the care of a child with a brain tumor. A comparable network should be available to survivors of these tumors since they may transition to adulthood with medical and neurological deficits and can acquire additional late effects of treatments as they age. Optimally, each survivor will have an individualized survivor health plan (SHP) that concisely summarizes the tumor, treatments, potential late effects, and screening that may identify evolving late effects before they impact mental, social or physical functioning. This plan helps patients, families, and the medical team advocate for surveillance aiming to optimize the survivor's quality of life. Failure to support the health and function of these heroic cancer survivors renders the medical advances, the courage, and the struggle that permitted survival meaningless."

33296153,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as impaired kidney function and proteinuria present over at least 3 months and is often present along with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 60mL / min / 1.73m2 is considered as a measure of impaired kidney function, which along with presence of albuminuria, abnormal histological findings (as detected through kidney tissue biopsy) or urine sediment abnormalities are used to diagnose CKD. Based on eGFR values, CKD is classified into 5 stages. Among them CKD stage 4 (eGFR 15-29 mL / min / 1.73m2) indicates severe loss of kidney function and CKD stage 5 (eGFR < 15 mL / min / 1.73m2) indicates kidney failure also called end stage renal disease (ESRD)., Earlier stages (stages 1, 2 and 3) can be asymptomatic and may be reversible with medical management."

33748919,"Thoracic aortic dilatation often has an asymptomatic course but may present with lethal complications such as aortic rupture or dissection, particularly when the thoracic aorta is aneurysmally enlarged; therefore, appropriate diagnosis, surveillance, and management are vital. Recommendations regarding imaging and surgical management are outlined in contemporary clinical practice guidelines. Dedicated guidelines regarding medical therapies for the management of thoracic aortic dilatation are lacking. Most of the medical treatment strategies, especially recommendations regarding pharmacological medical therapies related to β-blockade and angiotensin receptor blockers, are derived from data on patients with Marfan syndrome. The main aims of medical therapies for the management of thoracic aortic dilatation are (1) to control the progression of the disease, and (2) to prevent complications related to the disease (such as aortic dissection and mortality). This paper reviews the contemporary evidence and highlights the gaps in evidence to be investigated in further studies."

33231262,"Epilepsy is characterized as recurrent seizures, and it is one of the most prevalent disorders of the human nervous system. A large and diverse profile of different syndromes and conditions can cause perturbations in neural networks that are associated with epilepsy. Advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiological monitoring have enhanced our ability to localize the neuropathological lesions that alter the neural networks giving rise to epilepsy, whereas advances in surgical management have resulted in excellent seizure control in many patients following resections. Histopathologic study using a variety of special stains, molecular analysis, and functional studies of these resected tissues has facilitated the neuropathological characterization of these lesions. Here, we review the neuropathology of common structural lesions that cause epilepsy and are amenable to neurosurgical resection, such as hippocampal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia, and its associated principal lesions, including long-term epilepsy-associated tumors, as well as other malformations of cortical development and Rasmussen encephalitis."

Evidence suggests that laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy via stripping is the preferable surgical technique for management of endometrioma, compared with excisional / ablative techniques, in the fields of pain improvement, spontaneous pregnancy rates, and ovarian cyst recurrences. Ablation techniques, combined technique and three-step approach demonstrate a less decline in anti-Müllerian hormone postoperatively. A successful operation involves not only removal of ovarian pathology, but also maintenance of ovarian function and future reproductive potential. Patients should be counselled about the risks of surgery and the management plan should be individualised to patient's symptoms and reproductive goals."

36528315,"Background: Adult thalamic gliomas (ATGs) present a surgical challenge given their depth and proximity to eloquent brain regions. Choosing a surgical approach relies on different clinical variables such as anatomical location and size of the tumor. However, conclusive data regarding how these variables influence the balance between extent of resection and complications are lacking. We aim to systematically review the literature to describe the current surgical outcomes of ATG and to provide tools that may improve the decision-making process."
31729118,"Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for lipomas. However, linear incision methods or minimal extraction techniques often do not provide a sufficient surgical view. Therefore, removing large lipomas is often difficult. To present the Z-incision and half Z-incision designs for lipoma extraction, this retrospective study analyzed lipomas surgically excised at our institution between September 2015 and December 2018. The area of surgical field exposed by the Z-incision versus that exposed by the linear incision was calculated using a schematic model. Cure rate, complications, and surgical field area were investigated. A total of 84 lipomas were included. A Z- or half Z-incision was used to treat 30 lipomas, while a linear incision was used to treat 54 lipomas. The mean diameter of the mass in the Z- or half Z-incision group was 47.7 mm (range, 15-160 mm), larger than that in the linear incision group (25.5 mm; range, 7-59 mm) (p <.001). The Z-incision involved making rectangular windows by lifting 2 triangular flaps. According to our mathematical model, the Z-incision provided a larger surgical field area than that provided by the linear incision based on stretched angles (1.81 times larger at 30 ° and 3.14 times larger at 15 °). The Z- and half Z-incisions were successfully performed in all but 1 lipoma (29 lipomas, 96.7%). There was 1 lipoma that resulted in postoperative complications (seroma, 3.3%). The Z-incision design can be a useful alternative technique for the extirpation of lipomas, especially large lipomas. Here, we proposed a surgical algorithm for lipoma surgery based on tumor size."

37504306,"With the exception of well-differentiated liposarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, solitary fibrous tumour, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the majority of the ≈ 70 histologic subtypes of retroperitoneal sarcoma are defined as' ultra-rare'sarcomas, with an incidence of ≤ 1-5 / 1,000,000 persons / year. For most of these ultra-rare RPS subtypes, diagnosis and treatment follows international guidelines for the management of more common RPS histologies, with en bloc surgical resection as the mainstay of curative treatment, and enrolment in clinical trials where possible. Because the treatment of RPS is heavily driven by histology, the surgeon must be familiar with specific issues related to the diagnosis and management of ultra-rare sarcoma subtypes. Expert radiological and surgeon reviews are required to differentiate similarly presenting tumours where surgery can be avoided (e.g., angiomyolipoma), or where upfront systemic therapy is indicated (e.g., extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma). Thus, the management of all retroperitoneal sarcomas should occur at a sarcoma referral centre, with a multidisciplinary team of experts dedicated to the surgical and medical management of these rare tumours. In this focused review, we highlight how diagnosis and management of the ultra-rare primary RPS histologies of malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa), extraosseous Ewing sarcoma (EES), extraosseous osteosarcoma (EOS), and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) critically diverge from the management of more common RPS subtypes."

36084968,"A substantial number of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) have a pathogenic genetic mutation in a podocyte protein as the cause of their disease. The mutations can affect a wide range of cell functions including the actin cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and motility, mitochondrial function, and nuclear pore proteins. The likelihood of a genetic cause declines with age, from approximately 30% in children and adolescents to 10% in adulthood, and the specific proteins involved and the pattern of inheritance differ in the 2 age groups. The presence of a genetic cause for FSGS can have important clinical ramifications including the need for a diagnostic kidney biopsy, medical management, and the risk of recurrent disease after kidney transplantation. This review summarizes the spectrum of genetic causes of nephrotic syndrome, primarily FSGS, in adults with a focus on diagnosis, presentation, and management."
32472521,"Ebstein anomaly comprises approximately 1% of all congenital heart diseases. It occurs when the tricuspid valve fails to properly delaminate from the right ventricle, resulting in a clinical spectrum of abnormal tricuspid valve morphology and right ventricular dysfunction. Due to the anatomy of the tricuspid valve and right ventricle, as well as associated right- and left-sided pathology, patients are at risk for both right and left ventricular failure and the associated symptoms of each. Ebstein patients are also at risk for atrial arrhythmias, due to the atrial enlargement intrinsic to the anatomy, as well as the presence of potential accessory pathways. Arrhythmias are generally poorly tolerated, particularly in the setting of ventricular dysfunction. Cyanosis may also be present in Ebstein patients, due to the common occurrence of atrial communications, which can exacerbate other symptoms of heart failure. Treatment of heart failure can be through pharmacologic and procedural interventions, depending on the underlying cause of heart failure. While early heart failure symptoms may be treated with medical management, most Ebstein patients will require surgery. Various surgical and catheter-based interventions targeting the tricuspid valve and the atrialized right ventricular tissue have been developed to help treat the underlying cause of the heart failure. The optimal timing of transcatheter and surgical intervention in the Ebstein patient to prevent or treat heart failure needs further study."
31594702,"There are more than a dozen recognized hereditary forms of kidney cancer. While classic syndromic forms are readily recognizable, more recently described conditions are subtler because of lower penetrance. Adequate counseling and implementation of risk assessment before or after management are important aspects of clinical care. Germline testing to assess hereditary risk has rapidly evolved thanks to multigene panel testing, which can be performed quickly and at relatively low cost. This review discusses what is known about germline risk assessment, namely which individuals should be tested and when and how, and covers many of the uncertainties around this process. PATIENT SUMMARY: More than a dozen genes have been linked to predisposition to kidney cancer. We review genetic testing in terms of who should be tested and when and how the testing should be carried out. Results from genetic tests can help in tailoring screening and surgical management and in selecting the most suitable chemotherapy."

35099683,"The spleen is a complex organ involved in multiple physiological processes in the human body. Elective splenectomy is an uncommon operation, and the precise characterization of the lesion should be achieved to determine the risks and benefits of this operation accurately. Given the significant role of the spleen in homeostasis and the potential risks of the surgery itself and following sequelae such as infection susceptibility, accurate recognition, and classification of splenic lesions is required before surgery. This review provides an overview of malignant (e.g., lymphoma, angiosarcoma) and benign (e.g., cysts, hemangioma, hamartoma) splenic lesions that may warrant an elective splenectomy. Images from a cohort of adult patients undergoing isolated splenectomy for non-traumatic indications in a single center are provided. This review highlights the considerable overlap in imaging patterns between splenic lesions, splenic lesions masquerading as lesions in other organs, increased detection of asymptomatic splenic incidentalomas due to improvements in imaging modalities. This review also provides clinical correlations for each lesion, providing additional information to help clinicians differentiate between lesions and accurately identify diseases amenable to surgical management."

31764549,"Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis (CS) can present with both intracranial and extracranial manifestations. Extracranial features include proptosis, exorbitism, and midface hypoplasia. Intracranial manifestations can include elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), brainstem compression, foramen magnum stenosis or jugular foramen hypoplasia with resultant venous hypertension and anomalous drainage. While fronto-orbital advancement, cranial vault remodeling, and posterior fossa decompression are standard surgical approaches to normalizing orbito-cranial volume and morphology, associated hydrocephalus, anomalous venous drainage, and tonsillar herniation often affect the timing, safety, and selection of corrective interventions. The surgical decision-making to circumvent venous emissaries, effectively time treatment of hydrocephalus, and address posterior versus anterior pathology primarily has not been widely described in the literature, and is important in the development of guidelines in these complex cases. In this report, we describe the surgical management of a patient with Jackson-Weiss syndrome presenting with delayed, but rapidly progressive bilateral lambdoid CS, severe proptosis, midface hypoplasia, elevated ICP, hydrocephalus, tonsillar ectopia, and severe venous hypertension with anomalous drainage. We review the literature related to management of complex synostosis and present our surgical decision-making in the setting of complex syndromic synostosis to aid in the formation of guidelines toward approaching these cases."
30614382,"Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is a rare white matter degenerative disease characterized by both axonal and glial injury due to a defect in the CSF1R gene. In this report, we describe ALSP in a previously healthy 40-year-old woman presenting with insidiously progressive confusion, memory loss, and loss of social inhibitions. Characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings for ALSP elucidated the diagnosis, including chronic foci of diffusion restriction in a non-vascular distribution, lack of temporal / infratentorial involvement, cortical sparing, and lack of enhancement. CSF1R genetic testing further confirmed the diagnosis and the patient underwent supportive medical management for symptom control. ALSP can pose a unique diagnostic challenge given its particular adult-onset presentation, but early recognition is key given the poor prognosis and the potential for family genetic testing."

36587475,"Background: Macromastia in adolescents is both physically and psychologically debilitating during a period in life when individuals are particularly vulnerable to peer pressure and social norms. Early recognition and intervention by both pediatricians and surgeons are critical to avoid unnecessary suffering. While reduction mammaplasty is the gold standard for the management of symptomatic macromastia in adults, the management of macromastia in pediatric patients remains controversial. In particular, there is great discussion regarding the timing of reconstructive breast surgery in pediatric patients."

(1) Methods: The study included 30 patients with SLK. (Group 1) and 30 healthy controls (Group 2). (2) Results: The mean IL-6 level in Group 1 was significantly higher than in Group 2 (p = 0.001).
32620473,"Our objective is to describe the surgical management and outcomes following surgical intervention for aggressive spine hemangiomas. Patients from 2005 to 2018 with an aggressive hemangioma of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine and sacrum treated surgically at a tertiary referral academic medical center were included in this study. The hospital pathology department database was used to identify patients with a diagnosis of aggressive hemangioma. Patient demographics, medical history, operative procedure, adjunct treatment, early and late complications, and recurrence were analyzed using the Fischer exact test with significance set at p < 0.05 Ten patients met inclusion criteria for the study. The average follow up was 11 months. Eight out of ten patients had aggressive hemangioma of the thoracic spine. Seven of the ten patients presented with back or leg pain. The most common surgery was laminectomy at the site of the lesion (70%). 40% of patients underwent a spinal fusion, with two of these patients receiving concurrent intra-operative vertebroplasty. Three patients underwent post-operative radiation therapy. Five complications were noted among three individuals. There were three perioperative complications, deep venous thrombosis, renal insufficiency, one surgical site infection, and two postoperative complications, both revisions. There were no recurrences. Surgical intervention for aggressive spine hemangiomas is an effective treatment with relatively low complication and recurrence rates."
37492370,"Penetrating traumatic brain injury accompanied by perforating ocular injury caused by low-velocity foreign bodies is a life-threatening condition, a surgical emergency and a major challenge in surgical practice, representing a severe subtype of non-missile traumatic brain injury, which is a relatively rare pathology among civilians. Optimal management of such an injury remains controversial, requiring full understanding of its pathophysiology and a multidisciplinary expert approach. Herein, we report a case of penetrating brain and associated perforating eye injury and discuss relevant literature providing further insight into this demanding complex multi-organ injury. We present a case of 39-year-old male patient with transorbital penetrating brain and perforating ocular injury undergoing emergency surgery to remove a retained sharp metallic object from the left parietal lobe. Following appropriate and urgent diagnostics, a decompressive left-sided fronto-temporo-parietal craniectomy was immediately performed. A retained sharp metallic object (a slice of a round saw) was successfully removed, while primary left globe repair and palpebral and fornix reconstruction were performed afterwards by an ophthalmologist. A prophylactic administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics was applied to prevent infectious complications. Early postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged on day 45 post-injury having moderate right-sided motor weakness, ipsilateral facial nerve central palsy, and light motoric dysphasia. The vision to his left eye was completely and permanently lost. In conclusion, management of non-missile transorbital penetrating brain injury can be satisfactory when proper clinical and radiologic evaluation, and amply, less radical surgical approach is performed early. A multidisciplinary routine is a prerequisite in achieving a favorable management outcome."
35377078,"Purpose: The treatment of giant cell tumors (GCT) of the distal radius remains challenging, with no consensus on the optimal surgical management. Surgical management remains the mainstay of treatment with options including intralesional curettage and en-bloc resection with reconstruction. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate and compare the outcomes of these two procedures. (1) Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify studies comparing intralesional curettage and en-bloc resection for GCT of the distal radius."
33641424,"Aims: Osteonecrosis (ON) can cause considerable morbidity in young people who undergo treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The aims of this study were to determine the operations undertaken for ON in this population in the UK, along with the timing of these operations and any sequential procedures that are used in different joints. We also explored the outcomes of those patients treated by core decompression (CD), and compared this with conservative management, in both the pre- or post-collapse stages of ON."
33040640,"Introduction: Metastases to the central nervous system are the most common cause of malignant intracranial tumors in adults. Current standard of care includes surgery and radiation, but overall survival remains poor. A range of systemic therapies are emerging as promising treatment options for these patients. (1) However, the optimal treatment strategy for patients with brain metastases remains unclear. (2) We sought to determine the efficacy of systemic therapy for patients with brain metastases from solid tumors. (3) Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients with brain metastases from solid tumors treated at our institution from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2015."
32213020,"Stricturing Crohn's disease (CD) is a significant clinical problem. The presence of a stricture may be suggested by clinical symptoms. Cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography or magnetic resonance enterography is essential in diagnosing strictures as it allows further characterization and evaluation for complications such as abscess, fistulizing disease or malignancy. Managing small bowel stricturing CD should be approached in a multidisciplinary fashion. Medical therapy can be considered in strictures which are not associated with complications, with most of the data supporting anti-TNF strategies in this setting. If the disease is refractory to medical therapy, endoscopic therapy or surgery should be performed. Endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) is an option for short, uncomplicated and straight strictures that are within reach of a colonoscope. Although EBD has good short-term outcomes, repeat dilation is often required. Surgical options mainly include resection and strictureplasty. Strictures refractory to medical therapy, not amenable or refractory to EBD, or associated with complications or malignancy should be managed surgically. However, surgery may also be considered at an earlier stage depending on disease characteristics and patient preference. Postoperative recurrence is common, highlighting the importance of careful monitoring of the patient postoperatively and optimization of medical management accordingly. There is a pressing need to develop anti-fibrotics for the treatment of stricturing CD. This requires the development of standardized diagnostic criteria, patient-reported outcome measures and validation of endpoints in fibrostenotic CD. The STAR consortium is pioneering this effort in order to allow development and testing of anti-fibrotics in future clinical trials."
30220612,"In the surgical management of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) we aim to resect the tumour with clear margins in all planes. The aim of this study was to identify and compare overall survival in a group of 591 patients who had resections, and to relate this to the clearance of margins at the tumour bed. We used life tables to calculate survival at one, two, three, five, and 10 years after diagnosis by margin (clear = 5mm or more; close = 2-5mm; and involved = less than 2mm). Kaplan-Meier curves were produced for the margins alone, which were defined as clear in 480 patients (81%), close in 63 (11%), and involved in 48 (8%). Five-year survival was 81%, 75%, and 54% for clear, close, and involved margins, respectively, which highlights the importance of clear margins for survival. There is a significant prognostic implication associated with close, and particularly with involved, margins."
32515290,"Background: The surgical management of nodular thyroid disease has been influenced by the advent of molecular diagnostics and recent guidelines recommending a more conservative approach to low-risk thyroid tumors. The purpose of this study was to assess practice changes arising from the early adoption of current literature within a single high-volume center. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of all patients evaluated or surgically treated for known or suspected thyroid cancer at a single institution was performed (2010-2018). We analyzed the yield of diagnostic thyroidectomy for indeterminate (Bethesda III and IV) nodules, the choice of initial operation for likely malignant (Bethesda V and VI) nodules, and the rate of completion thyroidectomy. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess the significance of any observed trends. Results: Of 2497 patients who underwent initial thyroidectomy from 2010 to 2018, 1791 patients had a tissue diagnosis of suspected or known thyroid cancer by cytopathology (Bethesda III-VI) or surgical pathology (differentiated thyroid cancer). In patients with likely malignant nodules but no clinical evidence of invasive or metastatic disease, the proportion managed with total thyroidectomy plus prophylactic neck dissection fell from 50% to 10% (p = 0.007). The proportion with likely malignant nodules managed definitively with thyroid lobectomy rose from 2% to 19% (p < 0.001). The rate of completion thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer found in the initial lobectomy specimen declined from 73% to 26% (p < 0.001). Among all patients with cytologically indeterminate nodules (n = 1036), we observed a decrease in the rate of diagnostic thyroidectomy from 67% to 35% over the study period (p = 0.015). Conclusions: The early adoption of new diagnostic technology and management guidelines has manifested in a less aggressive surgical approach to known or suspected thyroid cancer. Long-term follow-up will be required to assess oncologic and patient-centered outcomes arising from this modern strategy."

32084613,Background: Patients with isolated occipital condyle lesions concerning for metastases rarely undergo surgical biopsies and are more commonly treated with empirical radiation with or without chemotherapy. This is likely related to the morbidity associated with open condylar approaches and the importance of surrounding structures. We present a minimally invasive technique to approach the occipital condyle using a tubular dilating retractor system. (1) Methods: A retrospective review of patients with isolated occipital condyle lesions treated with minimally invasive surgery was performed.
34559882,"Objective: Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the cervix is a premalignant lesion, and a precursor of invasive disease. It is less frequent than its squamous counterpart. During pregnancy, AIS is a scarcely described scenario, whose diagnosis barely differs from non-pregnant patients. Its management is challenging with hysterectomy being the definitive treatment. However, its high incidence in young patients makes fertility-sparing management an approachable option for selected patients. The objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, we describe a case of a patient with AIS during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Secondly, the available literature is reviewed."
