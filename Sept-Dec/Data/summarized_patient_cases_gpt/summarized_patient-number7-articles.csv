34707048,"A 65-year-old man experienced cough and shortness of breath 3 days after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates, and the desaturation deteriorated rapidly. The symptoms and radiographic abnormalities rapidly improved after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Intradermal testing of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine showed a delayed positive reaction. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 vaccine-induced pneumonitis. The timing of the onset of pneumonitis after vaccination and the results of intradermal testing suggest that Type IV hypersensitivity against COVID-19 vaccine may have been responsible for this clinical condition."
32398569,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe. In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease. In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date. We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children. Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members. The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days. Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza). Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19% -100%), fever (42%; 11% -100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11% -100%). Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue. Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered. Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign. Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally. Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates. Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit. Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies. Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm. Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths. Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded."
31491072,"Background: E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that heat a liquid and deliver an aerosolized product to the user. Pulmonary illnesses related to e-cigarette use have been reported, but no large series has been described. In July 2019, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and the Illinois Department of Public Health received reports of lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarettes (also called vaping) and launched a coordinated public health investigation. (1) We describe the investigation of this outbreak and the findings of the investigation."
37780871,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus-associated pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were often associated with hyperinflammation and elevation of several serum inflammatory markers but usually less than what is observed in non-coronavirus disease (COVID) ARDS. Elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL) -6, etc., are associated with severe infection. This study identified subphenotypes of COVID-19 ARDS patients by latent profile analysis in a cohort of Indian patients. Methods Data of n = 233 adult Indian patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a tertiary care teaching hospital were analyzed in this retrospective study. Only patients with acute respiratory failure (defined by partial pressure of oxygen / fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 200 mm Hg) and chest X-ray showing bilateral infiltrates were included. Results The patients' mean (standard deviation) age was 53.3 (14.9) years, and 62% were male. A two subphenotypic model was formulated based on the lowest Bayesian information criterion. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and serum IL-6 were latent variables in that model (entropy 0.91). The second phenotype (hyperinflammatory) had lower platelet count (p = 0.02), higher serum creatinine (p = 0.004), higher C-reactive protein (p = 0.001), higher ferritin (p < 0.001), and serum lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.009). Age-adjusted hospital mortality (p = 0.007), duration of hospital stay (p < 0.001), and duration of intensive care unit stay (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the second subphenotype. Conclusion Two distinct but overlapping subphenotypes were identified in SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure. Hyperinflammatory subphenotype was associated with significantly poor short-term outcomes."
32317601,"Objectives: The 2015 definition for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome did not require the presence of bilateral infiltrates. We tested the hypothesis that pediatric patients meeting oxygenation criteria for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome but without bilateral infiltrates would have different inflammatory biomarker levels and clinical outcomes than those with bilateral infiltrates. (1) Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome. (2) Results: Of the 535 patients included, the median age was 2 years (interquartile range, 1-5 years), and the median Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score was 5 (interquartile range, 3-8)."
31033882,"Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following trauma is historically associated with crystalloid and blood product exposure. Advances in resuscitation have occurred over the last decade, but their impact on ARDS is unknown. We sought to investigate predictors of postinjury ARDS in the era of hemostatic resuscitation. (1) Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult trauma patients admitted to a Level I trauma center from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015. (2) Results: Of the 4,040 patients, 1,004 (28%) developed ARDS."
33067060,"Background: No set guidelines to guide disposition decisions from the emergency department (ED) in patients with COVID-19 exist. Our goal was to determine characteristics that identify patients at high risk for adverse outcomes who may need admission to the hospital instead of an observation unit. (1) Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ED of a tertiary care hospital from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020."
32970368,"Objective: Adolescent e-cigarette use has risen to epidemic levels in the US, revealing a new phenomenon of e-cigarette vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI). It is important to better characterize EVALI in critically ill adolescents as this is a vulnerable and rapidly growing demographic. (1) We sought to characterize the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill adolescents with EVALI. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adolescents admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at a tertiary care children's hospital from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017."
32586724,"Aim: Previous studies have suggested a more frequent and severe course of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients undergoing active oncologic treatment. Our aim was to describe the characteristics of the disease in this population and to determine predictive factors for poor outcome in terms of severe respiratory distress (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) or death. (1) Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020."
31679201,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a potentially life-threatening condition for a many patients. The associated mortality rate may exceed 50% in some cases. The etiopathogenesis of the syndrome remains unclear, and in Greece the exact number of people suffering or dying of ARDS each year is unknown. In this study, we sought to record the clinical characteristics and outcomes of all patients with laboratory confirmed ARDS. This is a retrospective single-center observational study, conducted in mixed, closed-type ICU with 12 beds at a Greek public health system hospital. The medical records of patients admitted to the ICU from January 1, 2015, until December 31, 2016, were retrospectively studied, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 software. Patients were assessed using the Fisher exact test assuming variances. All tests were two-tailed. In total, 15 patients developed ARDS (5.4%). According to the existence of radiographic pulmonary edema image with bilateral infiltrates, 12 patients were classified in the early phase of the syndrome described by the term exudative phase and 3 patients were classified in the third stage of final fibrosis (fibrotic stage). According to the Fisher test, there is a significant correlation between age and outcome. The incidence of the syndrome among hospitalized patients in ICU is in line with the current literature, while the main predisposing factor in this study was acute pancreatitis."
34130236,Introduction: Chest radiology provides an opportunity to better understand the diagnostic characteristics of e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI). This systematic review aimed to summarize the radiological findings associated with EVALI reported in the literature. (1) Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. (2) Results: A total of 13 studies were included in this review.
31627214,"Background: An outbreak of Nipah virus (NiV) disease occurred in the Kozhikode district of Kerala State in India in May 2018. Several cases were treated at the emergency medicine department (ED) of the Government Medical College, Kozhikode (GMCK). The clinical manifestations and outcome of these cases are described. (1) The aim of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of patients with NiV disease admitted to the ED of GMCK."
31804206,"Purpose - to improve the results of reconstructive interventions on the aorta by improving methods for treating respiratory distress syndrome. The study included 15 men and 4 women, the median age was 48 ± 4 years. In all patients, on the basis of a clinical and instrumental study and in accordance with the AECC criteria, acute lung injury syndrome (ALIS) was diagnosed, and in fourteen patients (73,7%), the severity corresponded to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The diagnosis of ARDS was established on the basis of generally accepted criteria: acute onset; the presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest radiograph; a decrease in the PaO2 / FiO2 index of less than 300 mm hg. art.; the absence of signs of left ventricular failure. To maintain normal oxygen delivery values, we ensured a hemoglobin level of at least 100 g / l. In cases of heart failure (HF), inotropic support was performed. Basic therapy provided for the maintenance of adequate oxygen delivery, for this a hemoglobin level of at least 100 g / l was provided, and in the development of HF, inotropic support was provided. When analyzing the timing of administration and the effectiveness of surfactant therapy, there is a tendency to a more significant increase in the PaO2 / FiO2 index with the early introduction of surfactant. When using surfactant, mortality in cases of ARDS was 25,0-40,0%, and the time of respiratory support in patients was 136 ± 57 hours. Endobronchial administration of a surfactant agent is a pathogenically reasonable pharmacological method of intensive therapy of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the postoperative period following aortic interventions. Administration of surfactant therapy leads to a significant reduction in the terms of recovery of oxygenation, respiratory therapy and the stay of patients in the ICU."
34637995,"Background: Many patients with Coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) present with radiological evidence of pneumonia. Because it is difficult to determine co-existence of bacterial pneumonia, many of these patients are initially treated with antibiotics. We compared the rates of bacterial infections and mortality in Covid-19 patients with pulmonary infiltrates versus patients diagnosed with 'pneumonia' the year previously. (1) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with confirmed Covid-19 admitted to the University of Michigan Medical Center from March 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020."
32730234,"BACKGROUND As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) spreads around the world infecting people of all ages, clinicians and researchers are working to gather data on the presentation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Further study is necessary to better diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients. CASE REPORT We describe the case of an 8-year-old boy admitted with status epilepticus, who also tested positive for COVID-19, while afebrile, with no initial respiratory symptoms. Benzodiazepines were given per treatment guidelines, abating the seizure activity. He subsequently developed respiratory distress and desaturation requiring temporary emergent intubation. All clinical symptoms resolved within a few hours. Results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain were within normal limits. Results of a 24-h electroencephalogram (EEG) were abnormal, indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction. As a result of intubation and findings of bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, a COVID-19 test was administered and the result was positive. CONCLUSIONS For proper diagnosis and treatment, patients and clinicians should be aware that COVID-19 may not present in the typical fashion of respiratory distress and fever. The present case suggests a rare neurological presentation of COVID-19."
32449972,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading at a rapid pace, and the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic on 11 March 2020. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an ""atypical"" bacterial pathogen commonly known to cause respiratory illness in humans. The coinfection from SARS-CoV-2 and mycoplasma pneumonia is rarely reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We present a study in which 6 of 350 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with M. pneumoniae infection. In this study, we described the clinical characteristics of patients with coinfection. Common symptoms at the onset of illness included fever (six [100%] patients); five (83.3%) patients had a cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. The other symptoms were myalgia (66.6%), gastrointestinal symptoms (33.3% -50%), and altered mental status (16.7%). The laboratory parameters include lymphopenia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-6, serum ferritin, and D-dimer in all six (100%) patients. The chest X-ray at presentation showed bilateral infiltrates in all the patients (100%). We also described electrocardiogram findings, complications, and treatment during hospitalization in detail. One patient died during the hospital course."
32128062,"Introduction: Streptococcus pneumoniae endocarditis (SPE) occurs in < 3% of all EI cases due to the evolution of penicillin and vaccination. However, immunocompromised and unvaccinated patients are still at grave risk. Case: A 58-year-old African American male who used alcohol and intravenous (IV) drugs presented with confusion, fever, and hemoptysis. He had coarse rhonchi with a grade 2 / 5 holosystolic apical murmur. CT chest showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Blood cultures were positive for pansensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. Echocardiogram demonstrated large vegetations on the anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve with flail leaflet and severe eccentric mitral regurgitation. Patient was started on IV ceftriaxone, but after 3 weeks of therapy, he wished to leave against medical advice. He was discharged on combination oral therapy with successful resolution of SPE on follow-up. Discussion: Invasive pneumococcus is highly virulent causing irreversible valvular destruction or death. IV beta-lactams are first-line treatment, but there are currently no guideline-recommended alternatives for oral therapy. Recent data suggest partial oral therapy may be noninferior to IV only therapy. Conclusion: Switching to oral combination antibiotics after at least 2 weeks of IV therapy is an acceptable alternative to treat SPE."
34620968,"COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide increase of hospitalizations for interstitial pneumonia with thrombosis complications, endothelial injury and multiorgan disease. Common CT findings include lung bilateral infiltrates, bilateral ground-glass opacities and / or consolidation whilst no current laboratory parameter consents rapidly evaluation of COVID-19 risk and disease severity. In the present work we investigated the association of sFLT-1 and CA 15.3 with endothelial damage and pulmonary fibrosis. Serum sFlt-1 has been associated with endothelial injury and sepsis severity, CA 15.3 seems an alternative marker for KL-6 for fibrotic lung diseases and pulmonary interstitial damage. We analysed 262 SARS-CoV-2 patients with differing levels of clinical severity; we found an association of serum sFlt-1 (ROC AUC 0.902, decision threshold > 90.3 pg / mL, p < 0.001 Sens. 83.9% and Spec. 86.7%) with presence, extent and severity of the disease. Moreover, CA 15.3 appeared significantly increased in COVID-19 severe lung fibrosis (ICU vs NON-ICU patients 42.6 ± 3.3 vs 25.7 ± 1.5 U / mL, p < 0.0001) and was associated with lung damage severity grade (ROC AUC 0.958, decision threshold > 24.8 U / mL, p < 0.0001, Sens. 88.4% and Spec. 91.8%). In conclusion, serum levels of sFlt-1 and CA 15.3 appeared useful tools for categorizing COVID-19 clinical stage and may represent a valid aid for clinicians to better personalise treatment."
33256382,"Hyperimmune plasma from Covid-19 convalescent is a potential treatment for severe Covid-19. We conducted a multicenter one arm proof of concept interventional study. Patients with Covid-19 disease with moderate-to-severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, elevated C-reactive Protein and need for mechanical ventilation and / or CPAP were enrolled. One to three 250-300 ml unit of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibodies titer ≥ 1: 160) were administered. Primary outcome was 7-days hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were PaO2 / FiO2, laboratory and radiologic changes, as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety. The study observed 46 patients from March, 25 to April, 21 2020. Patients were aged 63, 61% male, of them, 30 were on CPAP and 7 intubated. PaO2 / FiO2 was 128 (SD 47). Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray was present in 36 patients (84%). Symptoms and ARDS duration were 14 (SD 7) and 6 days (SD 3). Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days as compared to an expected 15% from the National Statistics and 30% from a small concurrent cohort of 23 patients. The upper one-sided 90% CI was 13.9%, allowing to reject the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. PaO2 / FiO2 increased by 112 units (95% CI 82 to142) in survivors, the chest radiogram severity decreased in 23% (95% CI 5% to 42%); CRP, Ferritin and LDH decreased by 60, 36 and 20% respectively. Weaning from CPAP was obtained in 26 / 30 patients and 3 / 7 were extubated. Five serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (2 likely, 2 possible treatment related). In conclusion, Hyperimmune plasma in Covid-19 shows promising benefits, to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. This proof of concept study could open to future developments including hyperimmune plasma banking, development of standardized pharmaceutical products and monoclonal antibodies."
37363457,"Ischemic stroke is a recognized neurological consequence of an acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly infects endothelial cells, generating widespread endothelial inflammation. This may be the mechanism leading to an ischemic stroke. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 and inflammatory responses cause vascular damage, hypercoagulability, thrombin activation, platelet aggregation, and plaque shedding as a result of hemodynamic alterations, which increase the risk of ischemic stroke."
33103720,"Background: Advanced age is a well-known risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19. However, few studies have specifically focused on very old inpatients with COVID-19. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of very old inpatients with COVID-19 and identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality at admission. (1) Methods: This retrospective study included all patients aged ≥ 80 years admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, from January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2020."
33198954,"Bilateral diffuse infiltrates on chest imaging can present a diagnostic challenge due to a broader differential diagnosis which includes pulmonary and non-pulmonary causes. Malignancy is generally not considered under differential diagnosis at the time of initial presentation. Here we present a case of primary adenocarcinoma of lung manifesting as diffuse bilateral infiltrates on imaging. Our case is unique in regards to its acute presentation, rapid progression to respiratory failure, ultimately leading to the demise of the patient. This indicates the aggressive nature of this malignancy and its variable presentation, like male gender and young age, thus emphasizing the importance of entertaining malignancy in such presentations, especially if there is no response to conventional antibiotic therapy."
35981365,"Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics and treatment of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in order to improve the early diagnosis and effective treatment. (1) Methods: The clinical data of children with ALL who were diagnosed with PCP in our hospital from January 2014 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. (2) Results: A total of 12 children with ALL were diagnosed with PCP, including 8 males and 4 females, with a median age of 7 years (range, 3-14 years)."
31763461,"Background Acute pancreatitis is fraught with a variety of complications, which account for the mortality associated. Our case had a fulminant course, with three rare, near-fatal complications and was successfully managed conservatively. Pleural effusion due to pleuro-pancreatic fistula is uncommon, seen in only 1% cases, of which right-sided effusions are rarer still. Management modalities include conservative, endoscopic, and surgical options. Chylous ascites is an extremely rare complication of pancreatitis and is managed with high protein, low lipid diet, restricted to medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Extra-splanchnic venous thrombosis is uncommon in pancreatitis, and isolated renal vein thrombosis is very rare. Case Presentation A 34-year-old, chronic alcoholic male, presented to the outpatient department (OPD) in a state of shock and respiratory distress. Chest radiograph showed massive right-sided pleural effusion. The pleural fluid was hemorrhagic with markedly elevated amylase levels, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) confirmed the presence of a right-sided pleuro-pancreatic fistula. Left renal vein thrombosis was also noted. The patient improved with chest drain, intravenous (IV) octreotide, and anticoagulants. Subsequently, he developed hemorrhagic pancreatic ascites, which later turned chylous. This was managed with dietary modifications. The patient had a prolonged recovery but was finally discharged after 45 days. Conclusion It is a challenge managing the various complications of acute severe pancreatitis. We describe this case to emphasize maintaining a high sensitivity for timely diagnosis and appropriate addressal of all the complications for better patient outcomes."
33335817,"A 60-year-old male with a history of primary hypertension presented to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital, in Pakistan, with complaints of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. He tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction, with bilateral infiltrates found in chest X-ray. At admission, oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; hence, he was immediately put on non-invasive ventilation. Laboratory investigation revealed elevated D-dimer, international normalized ratio, and total leukocyte count. C-reactive protein was markedly elevated (82.5 mg / L), indicating the state of a cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Treatment started with antibiotics, prophylactic enoxaparin (40-mg subcutaneous once daily), methyl prednisone 60 mg BD and multivitamins. Intravenous tocilizumab (TCZ) 6 mg / kg was started from Day 1 to address the CRS. On Day 3, he complained of pain in the right lower limb with signs of hypothermia, numbness, and slight blackening of the right foot. Peripheral pulses were not palpable, and vascular ultrasound showed no vascular flow in the popliteal, anterior and posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis artery. The Vascular Surgery department declared the limb unsalvageable and right limb above-knee amputation. On Day 9, the right foot was blackened and atrophied extending up to the knee. Above-knee amputation was done, and he was discharged on rivaroxaban after 48 hours of observation. We conclude that heparin is effective in treating coronavirus disease 2019-associated coagulopathy, while TCZ, simultaneously, decreases the severity of CRS. Our case suggests that the concomitant use of TCZ and anticoagulation therapy can be beneficial in patients presenting with arterial and venous thrombosis."

37529801,"In this case report, we review a case of pneumatocele in a 54-year-old Caucasian male patient diagnosed with infection of COVID-19 29 days prior, presenting with complaints of dyspnea and sharp pleuritic chest pain located in the left mid-axillary region exacerbated by deep inspiration with an episode of significant forceful cough a day prior. Preliminary labs were unrevealing for leukocytosis or neutrophilia, with normal troponins, and COVID-19 negative upon presentation. Radiographic imaging was significant for bilateral infiltrates in the left upper lobe, air fluid levels with initial concern for abscess but with subsequent inference of pneumatocele. Imaging was negative for pneumothorax. The patient was monitored, remained stable throughout admission, and discharged after work-up for fungal and bacterial infection were found to be negative with expectation of self-resolution of the pneumatocele. In this study, we overview the pulmonary impact of COVID-19 in the scope of pneumatocele occurrence in the early recovery phase of the viral illness."
33505740,"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic causing multiple fatalities and morbidities worldwide. We report a case of severe pneumonia causing acute respiratory distress syndrome due to a coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium abscessus in an elderly patient with multiple myeloma in Florida, USA. Case Presentation. An 84-year-old male with a medical history significant for multiple myeloma not in remission was sent to the emergency department to rule out COVID-19 infection prior to continuing his chemotherapy sessions. At presentation, he had nonspecific mild symptoms and an unremarkable physical examination. He had significant blood test findings including serum lactate dehydrogenase 373 U / L, high sensitive C-reactive protein 17.40 mg / l, and ferritin 415 ng / ml. Xpert-SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Chest radiograph revealed patchy areas of interstitial infiltrates in mid to lower lung zones. During his hospitalization course, his oxygenation deteriorated, requiring mechanical intubation. Repeat chest radiograph showed worsening bilateral infiltrates. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and eventually weaned off mechanical intubation and extubated. On the 11th day of admission, he was found to be bradycardic and in shock, and he was reintubated. His labs showed worsening inflammatory markers along with kidney dysfunction to the point of requiring renal replacement therapy. He received both convalescent plasma and remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Eventually, repeat blood cultures came back positive for the growth of acid-fast beaded bacilli. While awaiting final culture and sensitivity reports, his antibiotics were upgraded to cover possible nocardia infection. Repeat blood and sputum cultures resulted in growth of AFB bacilli Mycobacterium abscessus 1 week after."
33442654,"Background: Isolated pulmonary valve endocarditis is a very rare form of right-sided infective endocarditis. Due to the anatomy, in most cases, just the tricuspid valve is involved. Diagnosis can be challenging because of non-specific symptoms (fever, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain) and difficulty of detection by echocardiography. Risk factors include intravenous drug abuse, congenital heart disorders, alcohol abuse, male sex and central venous catheters, or pacemaker leads."
32825873,"Pneumocytis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and Pulmonary TB (PTB) both are common opportunistic infections among HIV infected individuals. But concurrent infections pose a diagnostic challenge owing to similar clinical features. Data suggests a high prevalence of such concurrent infections in developing countries but limited diagnostic modalities especially in resource constraint setup limits accurate diagnosis. At our centre we came across 6 newly diagnosed PTB patients among HIV infected ones had persistent shortness of breath (SOB) and hypoxia despite starting anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT). We excluded concomitant bacterial pneumonia by imaging, sputum examination and blood culture. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was estimated and hypoxia by arterial blood gas (ABG). We found all 6 patients had elevated serum LDH, hypoxia and imaging suggestive of PJP were offered sputum for Geisma stain and standard treatment for PJP in form of Bactrim-double strength and steroid. 1 patient had PJ cysts in sputum. 5 patient's classical radiologic findings in form of ground glass opacities in lower lobes along with bilateral infiltrates and 1 had honeycombing. Serum LDH was elevated all 6 subjects. 5 were newly diagnosed HIV and 4 had CD4 count below 50 cells / mm3 and 2 had below 200 cells / mm3.1 patient had developed bilateral pneumothorax as complication. 4 patients responded to treatment and 2 (33.3%) died of respiratory failure during treatment. We were able to diagnose only severe PJP cases as concurrent infection with PTB as there was no availability of broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) as well as direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) test for PJ detection. A high index of suspicion for PJP even in PTB patients with low CD4 count will guide to appropriate therapy for both infections and eventually reduces morbidity and mortality."
33815967,"The use of electronic cigarettes among the young adult and adolescent population has increased over the past decade. Vaping is the process of inhaling an aerosol that is produced by heating a liquid or wax containing substances, such as nicotine, cannabinoids (e.g., tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol), flavoring, and additives (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol) using an e-cigarette. A multistate epidemic associated with vaping prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue an official health advisory on e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion with no specific diagnostic test. We present a case of EVALI before the COVID-19 pandemic time in a 23-year-old immunocompetent male student with an eight-year history of vaping. He presented to the emergency department with fever, shortness of breath, tachypnea, nausea, and diarrhea. The patient had no past medical history. The patient denied illicit drug abuse or known drug allergies. The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis and pneumonia. The patient's urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids with a history of vaping. Community-acquired pneumonia due to Legionella, Pneumococcal, Mycoplasma bacteria was ruled out. Influenza A / B, Parainfluenza, Rhino, and Adenoviruses were negative. A computed tomographyscan of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates. He was treated with high dose steroids, empiric antibiotics, high flow oxygen and managed in ICU for seven days. The patient was discharged on tapering doses of steroid and counseled to quit vaping. EVALI outbreak is strongly linked to vitamin E acetate in vaping products. EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion with a history of vaping and responds well to steroids."
33043318,"Symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 overlap with other important illnesses affecting young adults. We report a case of a 17-year old male presenting to the emergency department in the midst of a pandemic with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. He had fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and myalgias, with bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and developed septic shock secondary to infectious thromboembolic events. However, his blood cultures grew group G streptococcus secondary to his oropharyngeal infection, and he experienced an infectious thrombus in the internal jugular vein, consistent with the rare but well-described Lemierre's syndrome. This case report calls attention to the importance of maintaining differential diagnoses and thereby minimizing the biases and assumptions that come with clinical care during a pandemic."
32591180,"Background: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic the risk of misdiagnosis of other causes of respiratory infection is likely. In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients. (1) Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital in Italy. (2) Results: We identified 11 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia (5 males, 6 females, mean age 68.5 years)."
34926047,"Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a potentially life-threatening pulmonary condition characterized by hypoxemia with progression to respiratory failure, rapid onset of dyspnea, and blood loss anemia. While hemoptysis may be present and corroborates the diagnosis, it is absent in about half of the cases, resulting in a diagnostic challenge with variable presenting symptoms. Imaging findings on chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scans are also non-specific, often showing diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities. Because DAH is an under-recognized diagnosis, physicians should maintain a degree of clinical suspicion for DAH in patients with unexplained airspace opacities and no signs of an infectious etiology. This is especially important in higher-risk populations such as patients with hematological malignancies, who have a propensity for thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy compounded by the use of anticoagulants. Patients with hematological malignancies, namely acute myeloid leukemia (AML), are also at risk for drug-induced DAH due to the use of cytotoxic medications like cytarabine. Here, we present the case of a 48-year-old male with a past medical history of AML and myeloid sarcoma who developed shortness of breath after receiving cytarabine chemotherapy. Chest radiography revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. He was intubated and underwent flexible bronchoscopy, which resulted in a bloody effluent consistent with DAH. After ruling out infectious etiologies, we reached a final diagnosis of DAH and started the patient on corticosteroid therapy."
32734863,"We describe a case of severe community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in an immunocompetent 66-year-old man. He presented with one-day history of malaise, fever and emesis. Initial laboratory tests showed increased C-reactive protein level, normal white blood cell count and mild anaemia. The chest X-ray was unremarkable. A few days following admission his condition deteriorated to respiratory failure and sepsis. Chest CT-images showed bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusion. Pleural fluid and tracheal aspirates were positive for adenovirus by polymerase chain reaction assay. No other microbial pathogens were identified."
32317402,"Background: The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes. (1) We sought to describe the clinical presentation, disease course, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who were immunosuppressed. (2) Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 who were immunosuppressed at the time of diagnosis."
33230093,"BACKGROUND The diagnosis of systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma (ssSSc) with renal crisis is difficult because of its unusual presentation and rarity. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with worsening nausea, vomiting, and exertional dyspnea for 3 weeks. Initial examination showed blood pressure 182 / 108 mmHg without skin thickening or other skin manifestations. Laboratory investigations showed serum creatinine level 21.73 mg / dL and diffuse airspace opacities on chest radiography. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and started on emergent hemodialysis. He was anemic and became gradually hypoxic, requiring supplemental oxygen. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were positive for centromere pattern with titer of 320. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies were negative. He was started on therapeutic plasmapheresis (TP) and captopril, which resulted in significant improvement of respiratory symptoms. The kidney biopsy revealed thrombotic microangiopathy. Anticentromere, anti-Scl-70, and antiribonucleic acid polymerase III antibodies, drawn after 4 sessions of TP, were not detected. CONCLUSIONS Here we report a rare case of ssSSc with renal crisis in a patient who presented with acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and suspected pulmonary hemorrhage. Clinical improvement was achieved by TP and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The diagnosis of ssSSc was difficult and required an ANA pattern and kidney biopsy."

Associated symptoms included wheezing, chest tightness, and postnasal drip. He was recently treated for pneumonia with a 7-day course of levofloxacin because of an abnormal chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral infiltrates, but his symptoms failed to improve. He had a medical history of mild intermittent asthma and was on no active treatment. He was a nonsmoker. He was born in the United States. He denied any recent travel within or outside the United States, sick contacts, or illicit drug use. He did not have any pets and denied exposure to mold, hot tubs, a down comforter, or pillows. He worked in a vocational program and his hobbies included refinishing wood floors."
33647552,"Background: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with a high fatality rate (34%), which is higher in the presence of co-morbidities. The aim of the current study was to assess the clinical course and the outcome in hematological or oncological malignancy cases, diagnosed with MERS-CoV. (1) Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients with MERS-CoV infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia."
34626477,"Background: COVID-19 severely impacted older adults and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. Our primary aim was to describe differences in clinical and epidemiological variables, in-hospital management, and outcomes between LTCF residents and community-dwelling older adults hospitalized with COVID-19. The secondary aim was to identify risk factors for mortality due to COVID-19 in hospitalized LTCF residents. (1) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized LTCF residents and community-dwelling older adults with COVID-19."
35712335,"Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Epidemic KS is described in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). It primarily affects the skin, but it may uncommonly disseminate to involve extracutaneous sites such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver, and lungs. In this case report, the authors report a 26-year-old homosexual male who was admitted with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. He was diagnosed with an HIV infection about five months before index presentation, and he was commenced on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Physical examination was remarkable for diffuse cutaneous nodules over the lower extremities, back, and oropharynx. Chest imaging revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates, mediastinal adenopathy, and a persistent bilateral pleural effusion. Extensive diagnostic workup was negative for underlying infectious etiology. Transbronchial biopsy demonstrated proliferated spindle cells that stained positive for HHV-8 in keeping with pulmonary KS. Skin biopsies also concurred with the diagnosis of cutaneous KS. Interestingly, the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count was 647 cells / mm3, and HIV viral load (VL) was 500 copies / ml. This case demonstrated an atypical natural history of pulmonary KS in an HIV patient as pulmonary and disseminated mucocutaneous KS occurred with a relatively higher CD4 count (≥ 500 cells / mm3). It also reminds pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists to consider pulmonary KS as a differential diagnosis of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in HIV patients, even in the absence of other clinical and laboratory criteria that define the AIDS stage."
30242640,"To characterize the distinctive chest high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) features and clinical manifestations of primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS) -related interstitial lung disease (ILD). The demographic data, clinical manifestations, and laboratory and radiological findings of 527 pSS patients were retrospectively analyzed. ILD was defined based on the presences of pulmonary signs in HRCT. Two hundred six of 527 patients were diagnosed as pSS-ILD, and the prevalence was 39.1%. The three most frequent abnormalities in HRCT were reticular pattern (92.7%), ground-glass attenuation (87.4%), and bronchovascular bundle thickening (82%). One hundred twenty-four cases (60.2%) of the pSS-ILD patients had only a single HRCT pattern, which involved 86 non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) cases (41.7%), 22 usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) cases (10.68%), 8 organizing pneumonia (OP) cases (3.9%), and 8 lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) cases (3.9%), respectively. Besides, the more important observation was that 82 cases had no less than two HRCT patterns, and NSIP admixed with OP (43.9%), NSIP admixed with UIP (35.4%), and NSIP admixed with LIP (19.5%) were the most frequent. HRCT of pSS-ILD patients demonstrated bilateral infiltrates (99%), with abnormalities predominantly in the lower lobes (89.3%) and subpleural areas (81.1%), and a few lesions were characterized by hilum distributed (8.7%). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) revealed impaired diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and total lung capacity, and the rate of small airway lesions in the pSS-ILD patients was 3.5 times higher in patients of pSS. Logistic regression analysis showed that dry cough (OR 59.05), clubbing (OR 6.26), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (OR 21.38) and positive anti-Ro (OR 7.86) were relevant factors of pSS-ILD. ILD is the common pulmonary involvement of pSS and the prevalence of pSS-ILD is 39.1%. The single pattern of NSIP and UIP in HRCT are the commonest, and about 40% of the pSS-ILD patients possess multiple patterns in HRCT. The classification of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis cannot completely include the pulmonary imaging features of pSS-ILD."
37483750,"Background: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disease that mainly presents with dyspnea. PAP diagnosis can be easily missed in the background of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, due to the similarity of their presentation and radiological findings. We present a case report of a post-COVID-19 patient, who later developed severe PAP. (1) Case presentation: A 55-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a history of cough, shortness of breath, and fever."
32963897,"A 15-year-old male with a history of mild intermittent asthma presented with fatigue, coughing, vomiting and anorexia which was progressive in nature over the past month. The patient was found to have evolving chest x-ray infiltrates bilaterally, and hypoxemia without accessory muscle use. The patient was placed on non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for hypoxemia. A CT scan showed bilateral infiltrates in a pattern consistent with E-cigarette or Vaping product use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI). Upon further history taking, the patient admitted to electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use with a new tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cartridge prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient was started on methylprednisolone after which his oxygen requirement improved. This case highlights the need to continue to be diligent regarding the use of e-cigarettes in the pediatric population, and be aware of the constitutional symptoms that are associated with their use."
37854527,"Cardiac myxomas can rarely involve the right atrium, get calcified and involve the inferior vena cava (IVC). Early surgical intervention is critical to prevent life-threatening complications. We presented the case of a 39-year-old male with fever, cough and shortness of breath for 1 week. Initial laboratory investigations revealed leucocytosis and thrombocytopenia. His electrocardiogram was normal, and his chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates. Based on the findings of a high-resolution chest computed tomography scan, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, we made a provisional diagnosis of calcified right atrial myxoma extending up to the IVC. We managed the case with cardiopulmonary bypass via aortic cannulation followed by a right atriotomy. Post-operatively, the patient's condition improved and was doing well on monthly follow-ups."
32414522,"COVID-19 is a global public health emergency with more than one million positive cases across the globe. COVID-19 has a multifaceted presentation. We are herein to report two cases of SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis with an initial presentation of weakness and elevated creatinine kinase (CK). Both patients had no respiratory symptoms, they only complained of generalized weakness and were found to have elevated CK. Routine chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates in both cases and subsequently reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. To the best of our knowledge, there was only one literature to date documented SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis as a late complication of COVID-19 patient. Our cases showed that elevated CK and rhabdomyolysis can be the sole initial presentation of patients with COVID-19 and total CK should be ordered in every patient on admission."
32333431,"Objective: There is a paucity of clinical data on critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring extracorporeal life support. (1) We sought to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring extracorporeal life support (ECLS).

34903428,"Actinotignum schaalii is an emerging pathogen in elderly patients with urinary tract pathologies. Two cases of A. schaalii bacteremia are described. Case 1: 79-year-old patient with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was admitted to the ward for febrile syndrome, abdominal pain, and dysuria. Case 2: 95-year-old patient with prostatic adenomectomy, urethrostomy due to urethral stricture, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was admitted due to febrile syndrome, productive cough, bilateral infiltrates with right paracardiac image, and pleural effusion. In both patients, A. schaalii was isolated in blood cultures, identified by MALDITOF-MS mass spectrometry. Only in case 1 was it confirmed that the focus of bacteremia was urinary. It is important to suspect this emerging pathogen in urinary infections with pathological sediment without developing in traditional culture media to ensure adequate empirical treatment. Since most of the isolates show resistance to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole."
31863551,"Introduction: Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality globally, but unfortunately there is limited data available from South East Asia. (1) The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of CAP in a tertiary care hospital in South East Asia.

37899079,"A male patient in his 20s with a medical history of common variable immunodeficiency disorder, non-compliant with therapy, presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and severe hypoxaemia. Chest radiography demonstrated extensive bilateral infiltrates and an increased cardiothoracic ratio. Streptococcus pneumoniae urine antigen test was positive. ECG demonstrated diffuse ST-segment elevation. An arterial line was placed and demonstrated pulsus paradoxus. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an extensive pericardial effusion, with echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade. Emergency subxiphoid pericardiocentesis was performed with an initial drainage of 750 mL of purulent fluid consistent with pyopericardium. Immediate haemodynamic improvement was observed. The patient required a second pericardiocentesis for drainage of a relapsing pericardial effusion. The course was complicated by effusive-constrictive pericarditis requiring anterior interphrenic pericardiectomy. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and antibiotics led to a complete recovery."
34256898,"The patient was a 33-year-old man with a history of recurrent pneumonia, autism, bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, intermittent asthma, and nonischemic cardiomyopathy attributed to cocaine use who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory distress with bilateral infiltrates seen on a chest radiograph. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia but progressed to respiratory failure that required intubation and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. His medical history was notable for short stature, abnormal facial features, and, since childhood, at least two pneumonias per year that required antibiotics. The initial evaluation for an underlying primary immunodeficiency found that the patient had normal quantitative immunoglobulin levels, with absent CD19 + B cells. This case highlighted the evaluation of the humoral immune system for hospitalized adult patients with recurrent infections as well as the use of genetic testing to diagnose rare immunodeficiency syndromes."
32149364,"Pneumocystis jirovecii is a potentially life-threatening opportunistic pathogen particularly affecting the lungs, mainly in immunosuppressed individuals and HIV-infected patients with a low CD4 cell count. A 50-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of pleuritic chest pain and fever. He was also hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 86% on room air. Detailed clinical history revealed that he had fatigue, dyspnea, night sweats, generalized bone pain and a loss of about 10 kg in weight over the past six months without intention. Chest imaging showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Diagnostic bronchoscopy was performed. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage were received simultaneously. The presence of P. jirovecii was suspected in hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides, and Gomori's methenamine silver stain was used to confirm the diagnosis. A blood test revealed dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism, increased plasma levels of the gonadotropins and positive HIV antibodies with a CD4 + cell count of 48 / μL. CMV co-infection was found with CMV viral load of 6738 copies / ml in plasma. Herein, we present a case with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) that led to a new diagnosis of Human immonudeficiency virus. As in our case, diagnosis of disease through the pathological examination of tissues (biopsy samples) or bodily fluids could lead to the recognition of an unrevealed HIV-infection."
32354634,"The outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection in patients who have received a kidney allograft and are being treated with immunosuppression is unclear. We describe 20 kidney transplant recipients (median age 59 years [inter quartile range 51-64 years], median age of transplant 13 years [9-20 years], baseline eGFR 36.5 [23-47.5]) with SARS-CoV2 induced pneumonia. At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg / day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function. At baseline, all patients presented fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing. Half of patients showed chest radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates while the other half showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates. During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy. Six patients developed acute kidney injury with one requiring hemodialysis. Six of 12 patients were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor. Overall, five kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days [15-19] from symptom onset. These preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. Thus, in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients, SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by high risk of progression and significant mortality."

37731425,"Pulmonary nodules are commonly encountered in medical practice, necessitating thorough evaluation due to their diverse etiologies. Identifying the underlying cause is of utmost importance, particularly in patients with a history of extrapulmonary cancer, to differentiate between metastasis and other etiologies. We present a rare case of a 24-year-old male with supraglottic squamous cancer who developed multiple pulmonary nodules, which surprisingly were caused by a rare infectious agent. The patient presented with bilateral infiltrates on imaging, raising strong suspicion of metastatic disease from primary cancer. However, bronchoscopy and biopsy revealed no malignancy but confirmed the presence of Corynebacterium amycolatum, leading to a change in the treatment approach from palliative to curative. This case highlights the importance of considering other etiologies, especially infections, in patients with cancer and pulmonary nodules. Accurate diagnosis is crucial to guide appropriate management decisions and optimize patient outcomes."
34461005,"Introduction: The severity of clinical presentation of COVID-19 myocarditis ranges from incidental identification of depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiogenic shock requiring percutaneous mechanical circulatory support, to fatal fulminant myocarditis. In previously reported cases, surviving patients experienced improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction with the use of glucocorticoids and antivirals (+ / - intravenous immunoglobulin / convalescent plasma). We report the first case of COVID-myocarditis in a surviving patient where a persistently depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 35 percent) despite optimal therapy prompted implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death."
