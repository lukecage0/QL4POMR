ID,Summary
32484582,"Moreover, it discusses the evidence upon which the latest medical and surgical treatments are based, as well as numerous recent case reports. Further work is needed to elucidate the etiology of TA, clarify the role of pharmacotherapy, and optimize the surgical management that these patients receive."
30337239,"In spite of being very rare, congenital bilateral dacryocystocele is a possible etiology for neonatal respiratory distress."
30596352,"Common arterial trunk (CAT), or truncus arteriosus, is a rare form of cyanotic congenital heart disease and is highly associated with DiGeorge syndrome (microdeletion 22q11.2). The surgical management of CAT is complete repair in the neonatal period with resection of branch PAs from the CAT with placement of a right ventricular (RV)-to-PA conduit and patch closure of the ventricular septal defect."
35987882,"Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) is defined by a constellation of characteristics including micrognathia, glossoptosis and airway obstruction. Airway obstruction and feeding difficulties are the major presenting issues, and the severity of the condition ranges from mild, with minimal to no symptoms, to severe, with overt obstruction resulting in apnoeas, severe respiratory distress and cyanosis."
34173742,Background: Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) is a lung malformation characterized by overdistension and air trapping in the affected lobe.
36945291,"Ebstein's anomaly is a congenital heart defect characterized by the displacement of the tricuspid valve, and its leaflets to be malformed. Due to the defect involving the tricuspid valve, there is a reverse flow of blood into the right-sided atrium, which may lead to cardiac hypertrophy and edema of the lower extremities."
32429981,"Background: Congenital lobar overinflation (CLOI) is one of the most important causes of infantile respiratory distress (RD). We aim to evaluate our experience in CLOI management emphasizing on clinical features, diagnostic modalities, surgery and outcomes."
34847867,Background: Severe or critical congenital heart defects (CHDs) constitute one third of the heart defect cases detected only after birth. These prenatally unrecognised defects usually manifest as cyanotic or acyanotic lesions and are diagnosed postnatally at various times.
34592267,A neonate with a diagnosis of nonobstructive intracardiac type total anomalous pulmonary venous connection presented with profound cyanosis in the first days of life. The preoperative specialist echocardiographic examination also identified the presence of partial cor triatriatum dexter.
37078072,"Background: Truncus arteriosus (TA) or persistent arterial trunk describes the presence of a solitary arterial trunk arising from the base of the heart, supported by a common ventriculoarterial junction."
32294011,"d-Transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) associated with vascular ring malformations has seldom been reported in the literature. In this report, we describe two unusual cases of d-TGA associated with non-Kommerell diverticulum resulting in vascular ring."
