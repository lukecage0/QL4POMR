ID,Summary
37405817,We present the surgical principles and report clinical outcomes for 7 patients following surgical reconstruction of a traumatic sternal body nonunion.
32649563,Purpose: Motor vehicle collisions (MVC) are a leading cause of unintentional death and injury in the US pediatric population. Compliance with prevention measures such as seatbelts and child safety seats varies considerably with patient demographics.
35012752,Background: The aim of this study was to provide a description of vascular trauma and its management at trauma centers across Canada.
34560220,"We hypothesized from the results of several previously reported studies, that patients with a minimal aortic injury (BTAI grades 1 and 2) could safely be treated with definitive MM alone."
31467984,"Background: To describe the distribution of injuries, hospitalization rates by body areas injured, and surgery-requiring admissions, and to identify independent predictors of admission to a regional hospital in Jamaica."
30910750,"Objective: Spine trauma management in children varies from one team to another, and to date, no clear consensus has been reached. The goal of this study was to describe the epidemiology of spine trauma in children and evaluate the timing and techniques of surgery when it was required."
35186134,"Considering the significant burden of trauma, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is striving to develop a nationwide trauma system. Recent trauma system development in Saudi Arabia is the first step in improving national trauma care and may guide development in other locations, regionally and internationally, to improve outcomes."
30739872,"Conversely, intraperitoneal injuries are often caused by large compressive and shear forces produced during seatbelt injuries and almost invariably require surgical intervention."
34178201,"Pelvic fractures and sacroiliac joint (SI) diastasis are debilitating injuries which can drastically decrease an individual's functional capacity, and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Here we describe a case of bilateral SI joint CT guided percutaneous arthroplasty for osteoporotic SI joint diastasis and pelvic fractures, resulting in a rapid resolution of SI joint pain and restoration of the ability to ambulate in a previously wheelchair-bound patient."
35856824,"Background: Development of the craniofacial skeleton and different mechanisms of injury warrant different treatment paradigms for younger children versus those at skeletal maturity. Results: Of 220 patients meeting inclusion criteria, motor vehicle collision (n = 53, 40.8%), falls (n = 48, 36.9%), and assault (n = 19, 14.6%) were the most common mechanisms with more falls in younger children and more injury by assault in teenagers."
36105838,"Under very rare conditions, a tear in the ventricular wall can lead to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm: an external outpouching of the ventricle that is stabilized by the pericardium, thrombus formation, and/or adhesions. We highlight how CTA chest offers a reliable tool for tracking the stability of pseudoaneurysms in the RV and can guide clinical management through directing treatment strategies and appropriate follow-up intervals."
36103319,Background: Traumatic thoracic spondyloptosis (TTS) is a rare but devastating spinal injury often secondary to high-impact trauma.
34152863,"Background: Pancreatic trauma surgery is a complicated surgical procedure for severe pancreatic injuries, accompanied by a high incidence of complications and mortality. The number of patients who underwent emergency pancreaticoduodenectomy (EPD), the incidence of blood transfusion, the number of fistulae per patient, and the duration of mechanical ventilation and bacteremia in the mortality group were substantially higher than in the survival group (p < 0.05 each)."
34562724,"Introduction and importance: The ideal treatment of proximal humerus fracture remains a controversial topic, especially in the case of complex multi-fragmentary fractures. However, in limited resource settings, alternative less complicated fixation may be considered in highly selected patients without compromising the functional outcome."
30775107,"Case A patient presented at 36 weeks of gestation with multiple injuries after a motor vehicle collision and experienced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The use of a Bakri balloon in combination with external compression with Coban, a sterile self-adherent bandage, after delivery temporized her bleeding and allowed her to become stable for further management."
31338407,"Acetabular fractures are injuries that require significant force transmission, especially when associated with a femoral head dislocation. Our patient underwent a post-operative CT scan with the finding of intra-articular bony fragments that subsequently required arthroscopic removal."
30788109,
37546026,"Usually, patients with severe liver injuries, i.e., grades IV and V, are treated with surgical intervention versus angioembolization depending if patients are hemodynamically stable or not. We present a hemodynamically stable 53-year-old male patient with a grade V blunt liver injury with complete avulsion of the left lobe of the liver after a motor vehicle collision (MVC)."
32224680,"Case: A 19-year-old woman sustained a plantar flexion-inversion injury to her right ankle after a low-speed motor vehicle collision. Radiographs revealed dislocation of the calcaneocuboid joint, a rare injury, which was successfully stabilized by a novel technique using a hamstring allograft."
