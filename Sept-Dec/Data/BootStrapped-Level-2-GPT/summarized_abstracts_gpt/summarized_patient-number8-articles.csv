33762733,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can have viral or non-viral causes1-5. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need6,7. Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8 + PD1 + T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8 + PD1 + T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8 + PD1 + CXCR6 +, TOX +, and TNF + T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8 + T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8 + T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment."
34619251,"Recent data suggest that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major public health problem in Asia, with an updated population prevalence of 34%. In parallel, NAFLD-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is also on the rise. In this review, we describe the changing epidemiology of HCC in Asia over the past 30 years. While traditional risk factors for HCC (older age, male sex and metabolic factors) are also important in Asia, the PNPLA3 gene polymorphism is particularly prevalent in East Asia and may increase the risk of HCC. NAFLD among non-obese individuals is also commonly described in Asia. Because NAFLD is often undiagnosed, few patients receive HCC surveillance, and the target surveillance population beyond patients with cirrhosis remains poorly defined. As a result, NAFLD-associated HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, rendering curative treatment impossible. Finally, despite around 20-30 years of universal vaccination, chronic HBV infection remains prevalent in Asia, and emerging evidence highlights the importance of metabolic factors and concomitant hepatic steatosis on HCC development in infected patients. Future studies should explore the role of metabolic treatments in HCC prevention among patients with hepatic steatosis and concomitant liver diseases."
33657293,"Background: Infection and increased systemic inflammation cause organ dysfunction and death in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Preclinical studies provide support for an antiinflammatory role of albumin, but confirmatory large-scale clinical trials are lacking. Whether targeting a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or greater in these patients with repeated daily infusions of 20% human albumin solution, as compared with standard care, would reduce the incidences of infection, kidney dysfunction, and death is unknown. (1) Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients with decompensated cirrhosis to receive daily infusions of 20% human albumin solution (n = 515) or placebo (n = 515) for up to 90 days."
33227350,"Background & aims: Acute decompensation (AD) of cirrhosis may present without acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) (AD-No ACLF), or with ACLF (AD-ACLF), defined by organ failure (s). Herein, we aimed to analyze and characterize the precipitants leading to both of these AD phenotypes. (1) Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of patients with cirrhosis admitted to our hospital between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016."
34710362,"Background: Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common postoperative complication worldwide. WHO guidelines to prevent SSI recommend alcoholic chlorhexidine skin preparation and fascial closure using triclosan-coated sutures, but called for assessment of both interventions in low-resource settings. This study aimed to test both interventions in low-income and middle-income countries. (1) Methods: A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted in four hospitals in Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, and Nepal."
33832544,"Background: In children, up to 30% of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) develop into bacterial complications associated with pneumonia, sinusitis or otitis media to trigger a tremendous need for antibiotics. This study investigated the efficacy of Echinacea for the prevention of viral RTIs, for the prevention of secondary bacterial complications and for reducing rates of antibiotic prescriptions in children. (1) Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar."
35340032,"Background and aims: Patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) have high mortality. Corticosteroids improve survival only for 30 days. We targeted inflammation, cellular injury, and gut leakiness in a randomized clinical trial comparing combination therapy to corticosteroids on 180-day survival. (1) Methods: Patients with severe AH were randomized to receive either corticosteroids (n = 50) or corticosteroids plus a monoclonal antibody to TNF-α (n = 50)."
37159035,"Importance: The benefits of prophylactic antibiotics for hospitalized patients with severe alcohol-related hepatitis are unclear. (1) We sought to determine the association between prophylactic antibiotics and mortality in patients with severe alcohol-related hepatitis. (2) Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with severe alcohol-related hepatitis admitted to a tertiary care hospital from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015. (3) Results: Of the 524 patients with severe alcohol-related hepatitis, 524 (99.5%) received prophylactic antibiotics."
34924279,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the third cause of cancer death in men worldwide, and its increasing incidence can be explained by the increasing occurrence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). HCC prognosis is poor, as its 5-year overall survival is approximately 18% and most cases are diagnosed at an inoperable advanced stage. Moreover, tumor sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutics (particularly to cisplatin-based regimen), trans-arterial chemoembolization (cTACE), tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic molecules and immune checkpoint inhibitors is limited. Oncogenic signaling pathways, such as HIF-1α and RAS / PI3K / AKT, may provoke drug resistance by enhancing the aerobic glycolysis (""Warburg effect"") in cancer cells. Indeed, this metabolism, which promotes cancer cell development and aggressiveness, also induces extracellular acidity. In turn, this acidity promotes the protonation of drugs, hence abrogating their internalization, since they are most often weakly basic molecules. Consequently, targeting the Warburg effect in these cancer cells (which in turn would reduce the extracellular acidification) could be an effective strategy to increase the delivery of drugs into the tumor. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) and its activator PFK2 are the main regulators of glycolysis, and they also couple the enhancement of glycolysis to the activation of key signaling cascades and cell cycle progression. Therefore, targeting this ""Gordian Knot"" in HCC cells would be of crucial importance. Here, we suggest that this could be achieved by citrate administration at high concentration, because citrate is a physiologic inhibitor of PFK1 and PFK2. As shown in various in vitro studies, including HCC cell lines, administration of high concentrations of citrate inhibits PFK1 and PFK2 (and consequently glycolysis), decreases ATP production, counteracts HIF-1α and PI3K / AKT signaling, induces apoptosis, and sensitizes cells to cisplatin treatment. Administration of high concentrations of citrate in animal models (including Ras-driven tumours) has been shown to effectively inhibit cancer growth, reverse cell dedifferentiation, and neutralize intratumor acidity, without apparent toxicity in animal studies. Citrate may also induce a rapid secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, and it could favour the destruction of cancer stem cells (CSCs) sustaining tumor recurrence. Consequently, this ""citrate strategy"" could improve the tumor sensitivity to current treatments of HCC by reducing the extracellular acidity, thus enhancing the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs into the tumor. Therefore, we propose that this strategy should be explored in clinical trials, in particular to enhance cTACE effectiveness."
36558421,"Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine (SIBO) is a pathological growth of the intestinal microbiota in the small intestine that causes clinical symptoms and can lead to digestive and absorption disorders. There is increasing evidence that people with NAFLD have a distinct gut microflora profile as well metabolome changes compared to people without NAFLD. Thorough analysis of observational and RCT studies in the current databases (EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, Cinahl, Clinical Trials) was conducted from 3 November 2021 to 21 June 2022. The following inclusion criteria were applied: confirmed NAFLD, NASH, LIVER FIBROSIS, CIRRHOSIS due to steatosis; diagnostic methods of liver diseases biopsy, elastography, transabdominal ultrasound; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score; confirmed SIBO; diagnostic methods of SIBO − breath tests (hydrogen test; methane test and mix test; duodenal and jejunal aspiration before any type of intervention; adults above 18yo; number of participants ≥ 20; full articles. We excluded review articles, populations with HBV / HCV infection and alcohol etiology and interventions that may affect NAFLD or SIBO treatment. The quality of each study methodology was classified by means of the Cochrane Collaboration s tool (RCT) and Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale adapted for cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies. The random effects meta-analysis of outcomes for which ≥ 2 studies contributed data was conducted. The I2 index to measure heterogeneity and the χ2 test of homogeneity (statistically significant heterogeneity p < 0.05) were applied. For categorical outcome, the pooled event rate (effect size) was calculated. This systematic review was reported according to PRISMA reporting guidelines. We initially identified 6643 studies, from which 18 studies were included in final meta-analysis. The total number of patients was 1263. Accepted SIBO diagnostic methods were both available breath tests (n-total = 15) and aspirate culture (n-total = 3). We found that among patients with non-alcoholic liver diseases, the random overall event rate of SIBO was 0.350 (95% CI, 0.244 − 0.472), p = 0.017. The subgroup analysis regarding a type of diagnosis revealed that the lowest ER was among patients who developed simultaneously NAFLD, NASH and fibrosis: 0.197 (95% CI, 0.054 − 0.510) as compared to other annotated subgroups. The highest prevalence of SIBO was observed in the NASH subgroup: 0.411 (95% CI, 0.219 − 0.634). There were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of SIBO in different subgroups (p ="
35035378,"The gut microbiota is a newly identified contributor to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies of Bifidobacterium adolescentis (B. adolescentis), a species of Bifidobacterium that is common in the human intestinal tract, have demonstrated that it can alleviate liver steatosis and steatohepatitis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has long been considered as a biomarker of NAFLD, and recent studies have shown the protective effect of FGF21 analogs on NAFLD. We wondered whether B. adolescentis treatment would alleviate NAFLD via the interaction with FGF21. To this end, male C57BL / 6J mice on a choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDHFD) were treated with drinking water supplemented with B. adolescentis for 8 weeks, followed by the acute administration of recombinant mouse FGF21 protein (rmFGF21) to conduct the FGF21 response test. Consistent with previous studies, B. adolescentis supplementation reversed the CDHFD-induced liver steatosis and steatohepatitis. This was evaluated on the NAFLD activity score (NAS), reduced liver enzymes, and lipid accumulation. Further studies demonstrated that B. adolescentis supplementation preserved the gut barrier, reduced the gut microbiota-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and inhibited the hepatic TLR4 / NF-κB pathway. This was accompanied by the elevated expressions of the receptors of FGF21, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and β-klotho (KLB), in the liver and the decreased expression of FGF21. The results of FGF21 response test showed that B. adolescentis supplementation alleviated the CDHFD-induced FGF21 resistance. In vivo experiments suggested that LPS could suppress the expression of FGF21 and KLB in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, this study showed that B. adolescentis supplementation could alleviate NAFLD by increasing FGF21 sensitivity."
31700229,"Acute esophageal necrosis is a rare syndrome classically characterized by a striking endoscopic image of diffuse and circumferential black mucosal discoloration of distal esophagus, with an abrupt transition at the gastroesophageal junction and variable proximal extension. The typical patient is an older male with general debilitation and multiple comorbidities presenting with hematemesis or melena. The pathophysiology usually involves a combination of esophageal ischemia, backflow injury from gastric chemical contents and impaired mucosal reparative mechanisms associated with debilitated physical states. It may arise in the setting of hemodynamic compromise, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypothermia, alcoholic intoxication, trauma, inflammatory diseases, esophageal local infection, solid organ transplantation, postoperative status, drugs or acute gastric outlet obstruction, usually in the background of a chronic debilitating process, where the concurrent presence of multiple risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, malnutrition, malignancy or alcohol abuse, places a patient at higher risk. The characteristic endoscopic appearance establishes the diagnosis. Biopsy is supportive but not required. Management is mainly supportive and consists of correcting coexisting conditions, fluid therapy, bowel rest, intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy and red blood cell transfusion as needed. Although this is a serious life-threatening condition, appropriate treatment may result in a favorable outcome in the majority of patients."
36843910,"Purpose:: The burden of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) in the United States (US) has continued to worsen in the background of rising rates of alcohol use disorder. Patients with ALD present to care at a late stage, often with the sequela of liver decompensation, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and infection. ALD is now the leading indication for liver transplantation. We aimed to measure the quality of care delivered to hospitalized patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH) across 3 domains: 1) alcohol-use disorder (AUD) care, 2) inpatient cirrhosis care, and 3) alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) care-and observe associations between quality of care and outcomes."
31992948,"Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) is a facultative protozoan parasite implicated in amoebic liver abscesses (ALA), the most common extraintestinal manifestation of this infection. E. histolytica is endemic to sub-tropical and tropical countries and has been a major public health concern in northern Sri Lanka (SLK) for the last three decades. This has been attributed to a multitude of factors such as poor sanitation, hygiene, male sex, middle age, overcrowding, unsanitary practices in the production of indigenous alcoholic beverages, and alcohol consumption. Additionally, while rates of E. histolytica have declined substantially throughout the rest of the island, largely due to better infrastructure, it remains pervasive in the northern peninsula, which is generally less developed. Infection arises primarily from fecal-oral transmission through the consumption of contaminated drinking water containing cysts. Upon ingestion, cysts multiply into trophozoites and colonize the host colonic mucosa using lectin and cysteine proteases as virulence factors, leading to host invasion. Symptoms occur along a spectrum, from asymptomatology, to pyrexia, abdominal cramping, and amoebic dysentery. Colonization of the colon results in the formation of distinct flask-shaped ulcers along the epithelium, and eventual penetration of the lamina propria via the production of matrix metalloproteinases. ALA then develops through trophozoite migration via the mesenteric hepatic portal circulation, where microabscesses coalesce to form a single, large right-lobe abscess, commonly on the posterior aspect. The progression of infection to invasive disease is contingent on the unique interplay between host and pathogen factors, such as the strength of host-immunity to overcome infection and inherent pathogenicity of the Entamoeba species. As a preventable illness, E. histolytica complications such as ALA impose a significant burden on the healthcare system. This mini-review highlights epidemiological trends, risk factors, diagnostic modalities, treatment approaches, and opportunities for prevention of E. histolytica-induced ALA, to help address this endemic problem on the island of SLK."
33686051,"BACKGROUND The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which manifests mainly as a respiratory condition, has become a global pandemic that causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Although the symptoms remain mild in most patients, the elderly and patients with previous comorbidities have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with liver cirrhosis, especially after decompensation, may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to systemic immune dysfunction. CASE REPORT The patient was a 51-year-old man who was hypertensive, an ex-alcoholic abstinent for 6 months, and a smoker. He was diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis in July 2019, and was using norfloxacin at home for secondary prophylaxis of bacterial peritonitis. He was also using furosemide and spironolactone to control ascites and propranolol for primary prophylaxis of esophageal varices. The patient entered our hospital in July 2020 with cough, dyspnea, runny nose, diarrhea, and fever. During hospitalization, we confirmed infection by COVID-19 and secondary nosocomial pulmonary infection. Chest tomography compatible with ground-glass standard was performed. The patient developed the need for auxiliary oxygen but without invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient received dexamethasone 6 mg / day and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (he was started on cefepime but switched to meropenem). At the end of the 14-day isolation period, he was discharged with improved respiratory status. CONCLUSIONS Despite high mortality rates in patients with advanced cirrhosis who become infected with COVID-19, we report a case with a favorable outcome. Success has been achieved with the use of medications in studies of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the rapid detection of complications caused by the virus. Further studies in SARS-CoV-2 patients with chronic liver disease are needed."

30890750,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease. Previous studies on the association between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and NAFLD are inconsistent. Our study was aimed to find out the relationship between HP infection and NAFLD. We performed a large cross-sectional study in northern Chinese adults in 2015. 13C-urea breath tests were used to determine HP infection status. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed to diagnose NAFLD. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify the association between HP infection and NAFLD. A total of 4081 individuals were included in this study; 2137 (52.36%) participants were HP-positive, and 1022 (47.82%) were diagnosed with NAFLD in HP-positive individuals. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of participants with HP infection for NAFLD were 1.20 (1.06-1.36) in crude model and 1.27 (1.07-1.50) in fully adjusted model. When stratified by sex and dyslipidemia, the fully adjusted OR and 95% CI for NAFLD were 1.22 (1.10-1.80) in females and 1.44 (1.18-1.75) in subjects with dyslipidemia. There were not significant increased OR for NAFLD when stratified by age. The study indicate that HP infection is associated with NAFLD, particularly in females and patients with dyslipidemia, suggesting that HP eradication might be an alternative method for the prevention or treatment of NAFLD treatment."
30602573,"Background: Reversal of alcohol-induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α (PPARα) and PPARδ dysfunction has been reported to decrease the severity of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). Autophagy is essential for cell survival and tissue energy homeostasis. Emerging evidence indicates that alcohol-induced adipose tissue (AT) autophagy dysfunction contributes to injury in the intestine, liver, and AT of ASH. Methods: The effects and mechanisms of dual PPARα / δ agonist elafibranor on autophagy stimulation were investigated using mice with ASH. Results: C57BL / 6 mice on ethanol diet showed AT dysfunction, disrupted intestinal barrier, and ASH, which was accompanied by alcohol-mediated decrease in PPARα, PPARδ, and autophagy levels in intestine, liver, and AT. Chronic treatment with elafibranor attenuated AT apoptosis and inflammation by restoration of tissue PPARα, PPARδ, and autophagy levels. In ASH mice, alcohol-induced AT dysfunction along with increased fatty acid (FA) uptake and decreased free FA (FFA) release from AT was inhibited by elafibranor. The improvement of AT autophagy dysfunction by elafibranor alleviated inflammation and apoptosis-mediated intestinal epithelial disruption in ASH mice. Acute elafibranor incubation inhibited ethanol-induced ASH-mice-sera-enhanced autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, barrier disruption, and intracellular steatosis in Caco-2 cells and primary hepatocytes (PHs). Conclusion: Altogether, these findings demonstrated that the PPARα / δ agonist, elafibranor, decreased the severity of liver injury by restoration of alcohol-suppressed AT autophagy function and by decreasing the release of apoptotic markers, inflammatory cytokines, and FFA, thereby reducing intestinal epithelium disruption and liver inflammation / apoptosis / steatosis in ASH mice. These data suggest that dual PPAR agonists can serve as potential therapeutic agents for the management of ASH."
30218427,"Background and aims: The patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene has been associated with the development of alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Using a newly developed and validated assay for PNPLA3, we explored the prevalence of gene polymorphisms in a cohort of HCV / HIV-coinfected individuals to determine whether there was an association with insulin resistance or hepatic fibrosis. (1) Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of HCV / HIV-coinfected individuals who were enrolled in the HIV / HCV Cohorts of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS)."
32718222,"Alcoholic hepatitis should be suspected in every patient with excessive chronic alcohol consumption and recent onset of jaundice. Diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is based on clinical and laboratory findings, and confirmed by a liver biopsy when available. Several scores are available to assess severity and prognosis of alcoholic hepatitis. The 1-month mortality of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, as defined by Maddrey's discriminant function, is 20-30%. Therefore, severe alcoholic hepatitis should be treated with a 28-day course of oral prednisolone after systematic screening for infection. In this review, we discuss diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis, the different scores to assess severity of the disease, indications for corticosteroid therapy and alternative therapeutic options for non-responders to medical therapy."
31313853,"Background: Treating severe alcoholic hepatitis involves the exposure of patients to corticosteroids for 7 days to assess ""response"". ""However, the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy is unknown."" The aim of this study was to determine the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. ""Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who were treated with corticosteroids between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015."" Response ""was defined as a decrease in the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of at least 10 points."
36998141,"Background and aims: The host micronutrient milieu is a compilation of factors of both endogenous and exogenous origin. This milieu shapes the host's immune responses and can control the inflammatory response of the host when infected. Among vitamins, B12 plays a key role in the defense process because there is intense competition for it between pathogenic invaders and infected host cells. Alcoholic beverages and antibiotics can cause biological (in vivo) interferences that affect pathogenhost crosstalk. Ethanol is known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, and excretion of vitamin B12 in men and animals. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this backdrop are not fully understood. Here, we explored how Gram-positive ethanol-producing and Gram-negative vitamin B12- producing microbes of the infected milieu interact to influence biomarkers of host cell defense responses in absorbing, digesting, and defensive cells."

31827939,"Mediastinitis is a rare, progressive, and destructive infectious process due to cervical or odontogenic infections, which, if not diagnosed early, may lead to several complications, including airway involvement and even an imminent risk of death. Herein, we report an unusual case of a 37-year-old male with a bilateral submandibular hard swelling after the left third molar extraction. After surgical intervention with submandibular drainage and antibiotic therapy, the infection persisted without explanation, since the patient was not hypertensive, did not have diabetes mellitus or sexually transmitted infections such as HIV or syphilis, and did not smoke or drink alcoholic beverages. A thoracic surgeon then intervened, treating the mediastinitis surgically by drainage, thus obtaining a significant improvement of the patient's health. Mediastinitis is a serious condition. Clinicians and maxillofacial surgeons should be alert to make an immediate diagnosis and select the appropriate treatment in order to prevent worsening of the patient's clinical condition."

33528280,"The pathogenesis involving non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the context of chronic HBV (CHB) virus infection requires to be understood for developing improved modalities of diagnosis and treatment. We retrospectively investigated the association between NAFLD and CHB virus infection in the context of liver fibrosis. Among the 522 consecutive CHB patients who underwent transient elastography between years 2013 and 2016, we studied 455 subjects in the current investigation. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) scores were generally higher in patients with steatosis and fibrosis or cirrhosis. Antiviral treatment had significantly reduced the hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral load. Other liver function markers showed a significant positive correlation with both CAP and LSM scores. Plasma IL-13 was independently associated with increased CAP score where every increase of 1 unit of IL-13 was associated with an increase in CAP score by 0.98 unit. CCL11 was independently associated with LSM with every increase of CCL11 by a unit that, in turn, was associated with an increase of LSM score. We found that there was a high concurrence of NAFLD among patients with CHB virus infection. The presence of metabolic syndrome and chronic inflammation in CHB virus-infected patients were two independent factors that led to the progression of liver cirrhosis, with IL-13 playing the key role in linking the metabolic with the inflammatory components."

31199920,"Alcoholic fatty liver disease is often complicated by other pathologic insults, such as viral infection or high-fat diet. Autophagy plays a homeostatic role in the liver but can be compromised by alcohol, high-fat diet, or viral infection, which in turn affects the disease process caused by these etiologies. To understand the full impact of autophagy modulation on alcohol-induced liver injury, several genetic models of autophagy deficiency, which have different levels of functional alterations, were examined after acute binge or chronic-plus-binge treatment. Mice given alcohol with either mode and induced with deficiency in liver-specific Atg7 shortly after the induction of Atg7 deletion had elevated liver injury, indicating the protective role of autophagy. Constitutive hepatic Atg7-deficient mice, in which Atg7 was deleted in embryos, were more susceptible with chronic-plus-binge but not with acute alcohol treatment. Constitutive hepatic Atg5-deficient mice, in which Atg5 was deleted in embryos, were more susceptible with acute alcohol treatment, but liver injury was unexpectedly improved with the chronic-plus-binge regimen. A prolonged autophagy deficiency may complicate the hepatic response to alcohol treatment, likely in part due to endogenous liver injury. The complexity of the relationship between autophagy deficiency and alcohol-induced liver injury can thus be affected by the timing of autophagy dysfunction, the exact autophagy gene being affected, and the alcohol treatment regimen."

30957702,"Alcohol use, intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV infection are associated, but few programmes and interventions have addressed their synergistic relationship or been evaluated for effectiveness and acceptability. This is a critical gap in populations with high rates of alcohol use, HIV and IPV, such as Uganda's fishing communities. This study examined drinking norms, barriers and facilitators to engagement in a risk reduction programme, and ideas for tailoring. Results showed that alcohol use is common in fishing villages. While men and women drink, gendered notions of femininity deem alcohol largely unacceptable for women. Plastic sachets of liquor were the most common alcoholic drink. Participants did not understand the definition of 'hazardous drinking', but recognised connections between drinking, violence and sexual risk-taking. The idea of an alcohol, IPV and HIV risk reduction intervention was supported, but barriers need to be addressed, including how best to help those uninterested in reducing their drinking, addressing normalisation of drinking and how best to inform those who truly need intervention. Intervention to people living with HIV around the time of diagnosis and treatment may be warranted. Study findings highlight the potential to integrate alcohol and IPV reduction programmes into an HIV service provision."

We describe a case of a 49-year-old man who received a liver transplant due to alcoholic cirrhosis. On postoperative day 14, necrosis was noticed at the surgical site. After mucormycosis was diagnosed, monotherapy with amphotericin was started along with surgical debridements. Due to continued clinical deterioration, triple antifungal therapy was started with amphotericin, micafungin and posaconazole. Treatment with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was also started. Despite therapy, the patient expired on postoperative day 31. We review the risk factors for mucormycosis infection in solid-organ transplant recipients as well as evidence for current treatment options. We also review the 15 previously reported cases of surgical-site mucormycosis infections in solid-organ transplant recipients, including time to infection, infecting organisms, mortality and treatments."
36013566,"Background and Objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer with a highly unfavorable prognosis. Aims: Retrospective statistical analysis of patients with HCC in the field of liver cirrhosis treated at our center from the perspective of demography, and the effects of key changes in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the last 10 years on overall survival (OS) and earlier diagnosis. Materials and Methods: This study included 170 cirrhotic patients with HCC (136 men, 80%). Demographic and etiological factors and OS were analyzed based on distribution into three groups according to the period and key changes in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches (BCLC classification staging; standardization of protocol for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis C (HCV); expansion of systemic oncological therapy). Results: The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 69.3 years (SD = 8.1), and etiology was as follows: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 39%, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) 36%, HCV 18%, cryptogenic liver cirrhosis 3%, chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV) 2%, and other etiology 2%. Distribution of stages according to the BCLC: 0 + A 36%, B 31%, C 22%, and D 11%. However, the distribution in the first studied period was as follows: 0 + A 15%, B 34%, C 36%, and D 15%; and in the last period: 0 + A 45%, B 27%, C 17%, and D 11%, and difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The median OS for stages 0 + A, B, C, and D was 58, 19, 6, and 2 months, respectively. During the monitored period, there was a visible increase in the etiology of ALD from 30% to 47% and a decrease in HCV from 22% to 11%. In patients treated with TACE (stage B), the median OS grew from 10 to 24 months (p < 0.0001) between the marginal monitored periods. Conclusions: We described a decreasing number of patients with HCV-related HCC during follow-up possibly linked with the introduction of DAA. In our cohort, an improvement in early-stage diagnosis was found, which we mainly concluded as a result of proper ultrasound surveillance, the institution of a HCV treatment center, and increased experience of our sonographers with an examination of cirrhotic patients. Lastly, we described significantly improved overall survival in patients with intermediate-"

33590677,"Pasteurellosis is one of the rabbit's most bacterial severe diseases and leads to considerable financial damages in large production systems worldwide. Antibiotic use in animals may lead to antibiotic residues in animal products, including meat. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the potential role of grape seed extract (GSE) in treating Pasteurella multocida infection in rabbits. For this purpose, 45 weaned male New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups; control, infected and infected-GSE treated. Experimental P. multocida infection in rabbits induced a remarkable decrease in body weight, body weight gain, as well as microcytic hypochromic anaemia, leucocytosis, neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia. Also, a significant increase in the hepatic and renal injury biomarkers, in interleukin-6, total globulin, α, β and γ globulins, as well as a marked reduction in total protein and albumin, were recorded in the P. multocida-infected rabbits. Treatment of infected rabbits with GSE modulated most of these altered parameters. This study endorses the administration of GSE for the treatment of Pasteurellosis in rabbits. Further studies are required to identify the possible additional effects, appropriate doses and duration of the GSE therapy in rabbits Pasteurellosis."

35989851,"Lumbar hernia is an uncommon condition that can either be congenital or acquired. Acquired lumbar hernia is further divided into primary, with no identifiable cause, and secondary, occurring due to previous trauma, infection, or surgery. Here, we present the case of inferior lumbar hernia in a 65-year-old Asian male who was a chronic alcoholic and smoker. He presented with a complaint of a longstanding swelling in the right lumbar region for five years and no other associated symptoms. The swelling was reducible, an expansile cough impulse was felt on palpation, and bowel sounds were heard on auscultation. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a 6.7 cm defect in the lateral abdominal wall in the right lumbar region with bowel loops, cecum, ascending colon, mesentery, and mesenteric artery seen herniating through the defect. There was a history of an iliopsoas abscess at the same site five years ago, which was treated with incision and drainage. The patient was advised for an open mesh repair but could not be operated upon due to coexisting aortic stenosis and regurgitation. Our impression, from this report, is that a chronic iliopsoas abscess tracking to the inferior lumbar region and the incision and drainage thereof, leading to a weakness in the abdominal wall, may be considered to be a cause of inferior lumbar hernia, with chronic smoking on part of the patient being a significant contributing factor for the abdominal muscle weakness. Therefore prompt and meticulous treatment of an iliopsoas abscess must be done to prevent this complication."

32192740,"Leishmaniasis is an infection caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania, transmitted by sandflies and endemic to more than 88 countries. Visceral leishmaniasis in immunosuppressed patients is a growing concern. We report the case of a 61-year-old male patient with a previous history of alcoholic cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis who underwent liver transplantation for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Thirty-six days after the procedure, the patient showed an increase in liver enzymes and was diagnosed with moderate acute rejection of the graft. He was treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, and while showing improvement in biochemical markers, he became febrile 12 days after corticosteroid treatment. He presented daily episodes of fever, even after the use of several antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal agents, and a number of negative cultures from different sites were obtained. A bone marrow biopsy was then performed, showing a large number of amastigote forms of Leishmania spp. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was initiated; however, the patient progressed to refractory septic shock and death. This case highlights several aspects of visceral leishmaniasis in liver transplant recipients, such as the association of malnutrition to Leishmania infection and the challenges of diagnosing leishmaniasis in cirrhotic patients in which splenomegaly and pancytopenia, the hallmarks of leishmaniasis, may also be attributed to portal hypertension and end-stage liver disease. A high index of suspicion is necessary for the correct diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis in this group of patients. This study is compliant with the Helsinki Congress and the Istanbul Declaration."

30935688,"Autophagy is an intracellular recycling and degradation process for regulating cell survival and drug resistance. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is becoming a widespread disease in developing countries. However, the role of autophagy in NASH has not yet been fully elucidated. The present study determined that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), in the inflammation and autophagy regulation, was the key in the progression of NASH. In NASH mouse and cell models, STAT3 mRNA and protein expressions were significantly increased, while the induction of autophagy was radically decreased. Furthermore, the effects of metformin on STAT3 expression level and NASH inflammation were investigated. The current results showed that metformin activated autophagy and decreased the mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α via inhibition of the STAT3 mRNA and protein expression. The siRNA targeting STAT3 activated autophagy and inhibited the NASH inflammatory response by reducing the mRNA expressions of the inflammatory cytokines in vivo and in vitro. The correlation between autophagy and inflammation was also explored. Autophagy induced by metformin attenuated the inflammatory response. This phenomenon of inflammation reduction was partially restored by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methylindole (3-MA). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that metformin alleviated the inflammatory response in the liver and the hepatocyte of the NASH model via STAT3-mediated autophagy induction. This mechanism provides a strategy for targeting the NASH inflammatory response."
32356496,"Aims: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a slowly progressive disease, often transmitted among people who inject drugs (PWID). Mortality in PWID is high, with an overrepresentation of drug-related causes. This study investigated the risk of death in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with or without illicit substance use disorder (ISUD).Methods: Patients with HCV were identified using the Swedish National Patient Registry according to the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) code B18.2, with ≤ 5 matched comparators from the general population. Patients with ≥ 2 physician visits with ICD-10 codes F11, F12, F14, F15, F16, or F19 were considered to have ISUD. The underlying cause of death was analyzed for alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic liver disease, liver cancer, drug-related and external causes, non-liver cancers, or other causes. Mortality risks were assessed using the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) with 95% CIs and Cox regression analyses for cause-specific hazard ratios.Results: In total, 38,186 patients with HCV were included, with 31% meeting the ISUD definition. Non-alcoholic liver disease SMRs in patients with and without ISUD were 123.2 (95% CI, 103.7-145.2) and 69.4 (95% CI, 63.8-75.3), respectively. The significant independent factors associated with non-alcoholic liver disease mortality were older age, being unmarried, male sex, and having ISUD.Conclusions: The relative risks for non-alcoholic liver disease mortality were elevated for patients with ISUD. Having ISUD was a significant independent factor for non-alcoholic liver disease. Thus, patients with HCV with ISUD should be given HCV treatment to reduce the risk for liver disease."
33251981,"Introduction: Liver transplantation (LT) is the most effective treatment modality in patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD). With the increased prevalence of diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), coupled with a steady increase in the age of transplant population, liver transplant candidates are at increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Improvements in anesthesia, surgical experiences, and increased effectiveness of drugs have facilitated concurrent surgical interventions in transplantation, allowing for orthotopic LT to be performed in elderly patients with a high incidence of coexisting diseases, especially those of the cardiovascular system. In this study, we present two cases of combined off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery and living donor liver transplantation."
34970255,"Background: Human parvovirus B19 (B19) can cause acute hepatitis and is attributed to the high mortality of alcoholic hepatitis (AH). B19 infection is generally self-healing in previously healthy people, but it can cause fatal effects in some high-risk groups and increase its virulence and infectivity. Disseminated B19 infection-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in patients with AH has not been reported yet. Here, we described B19 viremia in an adult patient with AH accompanied by hemolytic anemia (HA), leading to disseminated infection and secondary MODS, as well as self-limiting B19 infections in seven nurses caring for him.

31238471,"We here report a case of scleral buckle infection with fulminant scleral abscess secondary to Moraxella species. A 54-year-old chronic alcoholic male with a history of retinal detachment repair, with scleral buckle 8 years prior, presented with complaints of severe pain, redness, and swelling in the right eye since 2 weeks. The patient was diagnosed with scleral buckle infection, the buckle was removed, and cultures revealed Moraxella species. The postoperative course included fulminant scleral abscess treated with dual antibiotic therapy that included ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin. All systemic antibiotics were discontinued after 3 weeks, retina remained attached, and no recurrence occurred over a 1-year follow-up. Moraxella, though commonly associated with bacterial keratitis, can also lead to buckle infection, especially in chronic alcoholic and immunocompromised patients. In buckle infection, infected buckle along with sutures should be immediately removed without damaging underlying compromised sclera. Lastly, culture and drug sensitivity play a very important role in buckle infections."
37609656,"Background: A subacute manifestation of muscle weakness in temporal association with a diarrheal intestinal infection is always suspicious of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is characterized as an acute inflammatory polyneuroradiculopathy, mediated by cross-reacting autoantibodies and typically triggered by various infections, vaccinations or other causes. Hyponatremia can be associated with GBS and is usually seen in more severe cases. However, the presence of relevant hyponatremia in a case suspicious of GBS can lead to a diagnostic dilemma. We here describe an intriguing and initially misleading case of hyponatremia mimicking GBS, where repeated and thorough electrophysiology was the key to the correct diagnosis."
30473364,"This report presents further evidence on the escalating alcohol consumption in the UK and the burden of liver disease associated with this major risk factor, as well as the effects on hospital and primary care. We reiterate the need for fiscal regulation by the UK Government if overall alcohol consumption is to be reduced sufficiently to improve health outcomes. We also draw attention to the effects of drastic cuts in public services for alcohol treatment, the repeated failures of voluntary agreements with the drinks industry, and the influence of the industry through its lobbying activities. We continue to press for reintroduction of the alcohol duty escalator, which was highly effective during the 5 years it was in place, and the introduction of minimum unit pricing in England, targeted at the heaviest drinkers. Results from the introduction of minimum unit pricing in Scotland, with results from Wales to follow, are likely to seriously expose the weakness of England's position. The increasing prevalence of obesity-related liver disease, the rising number of people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and its complications, and increasing number of cases of end-stage liver disease and primary liver cancers from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease make apparent the need for an obesity strategy for adults. We also discuss the important effects of obesity and alcohol on disease progression, and the increased risk of the ten most common cancers (including breast and colon cancers). A new in-depth analysis of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and total societal costs shows the extraordinarily large expenditures that could be saved or redeployed elsewhere in the NHS. Excellent results have been reported for new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C virus infection, making elimination of chronic infection a real possibility ahead of the WHO 2030 target. However, the extent of unidentified cases remains a problem, and will also apply when new curative drugs for hepatitis B virus become available. We also describe efforts to improve standards of hospital care for liver disease with better understanding of current service deficiencies and a new accreditation process for hospitals providing liver services. New commissioning arrangements for primary and community care represent progress, in terms of effective screening of high-risk subjects and the early detection of liver disease."

31574533,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. A variety of factors can contribute to the onset of this disease, including viral infection, obesity, alcohol abuse and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). These stressors predominantly introduce chronic inflammation leading to liver cirrhosis and finally the onset of HCC; however, approximately 20% of HCC cases arise in the absence of cirrhosis via a poorly defined mechanism. The atypical cyclin-like protein Spy1 is capable of overriding cell cycle checkpoints, promoting proliferation and has been implicated in HCC. We hypothesize that Spy1 promotes sustained proliferation making the liver more susceptible to accumulation of deleterious mutations, leading to the development of non-cirrhotic HCC. We report for the first time that elevation of Spy1 within the liver of a transgenic mouse model leads to enhanced spontaneous liver tumourigenesis. We show that the abundance of Spy1 enhanced fat deposition within the liver and decreased the inflammatory response. Interestingly, Spy1 transgenic mice have a significant reduction in fibrosis and sustained rates of hepatocyte proliferation, and endogenous levels of Spy1 are downregulated during the normal fibrotic response. Our results provide support that abnormal regulation of Spy1 protein drives liver tumorigenesis in the absence of elevated fibrosis and, hence, may represent a potential mechanism behind non-cirrhotic HCC. This work may implicate Spy1 as a prognostic indicator and / or potential target in the treatment of diseases of the liver, such as HCC. The cyclin-like protein Spy1 enhances lipid deposition and reduces fibrosis in the liver. Spy1 also promotes increased hepatocyte proliferation and onset of non-cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, Spy1 may be used as a potential target in the treatment of HCC."
31362807,"BackgroundMonitoring trends in mortality for individuals diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are important as we expand treatment and move towards World Health Organization elimination targets.AimTo estimate mortality rates for individuals aged ≥ 15 years diagnosed with HCV infection in England 2008-16.MethodsAn observational cohort study whereby death certificate information was linked to the Sentinel Surveillance of Blood Borne Virus Testing in England. Age-sex standardised mortality rates (ASMR) for individuals diagnosed with HCV infection (2008-16) were calculated and compared to the general population.ResultsOf 43,895 individuals with HCV infection, 2,656 (6.3%) died. All-cause ASMRs were 2,834.2 per 100,000 person years (PY), 2.3 times higher than in the general population. In individuals aged 30-69 years, all-cause mortality rates were 1,768.9 per 100,000 PY among individuals with HCV, 4.7 times higher than in the general population. ASMRs had not decreased between 2010 (2,992) and 2016 (2,340; p = 0.10), with no change from 2014 (p = 0.058). ASMRs were 441.0 times higher for hepatitis, 34.4 times higher for liver cancer, 8.1 times higher for end stage liver disease and 6.4 times higher for external causes than in the general population.ConclusionsMortality was higher in individuals with diagnosed HCV infection compared to the general population, highlighting health inequalities. There is a need to improve HCV diagnosis, engagement in care and treatment rates. The high mortality from external causes highlights the importance of integrated health and social care strategies and addressing the needs of this vulnerable population."
33402301,"Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that is expected to have a therapeutic effect on SARS-CoV2 infection. Teratogenicity and hyperuricemia are known as the main side effects of favipiravir, but little is known about other side effects. This report describes a case of cholestatic liver injury induced by favipiravir. A 73-year-old Japanese with a history of alcoholic hepatitis was infected with SARS-CoV2. Drug therapy was instituted with lopinavir / ritonavir combined with interferon β-1b. However, his condition worsened despite additional support with continuous hemodiafiltration and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We suspected complications of bacterial pneumonia and started favipiravir in addition to antimicrobial therapy. Favipiravir was administered at 6000 mg / day on the first day and 2400 mg / day for the second and subsequent days for 14 days. After the initiation of antibiotics, transaminase and total bilirubin were elevated, suggesting a transient cholestasic liver dysfunction. The liver dysfunction in this case may have been triggered by antibacterial treatment, and high dose of favipiravir may have promoted the deterioration of liver function. Monitoring of liver function is vital and close attention should be paid when using favipiravir at high doses or in patients with impaired liver function."

35764547,"Objective: To understand the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis, so as to provide theoretical basis for disease diagnosis and treatment, formulation of intervention measures, and improve the level of disease diagnosis and treatment. Methods: Hospitalized patients who were initially diagnosed with liver cirrhosis at Peking University First Hospital from August 2017 to December 2018 were selected retrospectively as the research objects. Liver cirrhosis demographic data, etiology, severity classification, incidence of complications, diagnosis and prognosis were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Results: Among all liver cirrhosis cases, there were 291 males and 209 females, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4: 1 and an age of 59.5 ± 12.9 years as at August 2017 to December 2018. HBV infection, alcoholic liver disease, and autoimmune liver diseases were the most common etiology of liver cirrhosis. HBV infection alone, HBV infection combined with other factors, alcoholic liver disease alone, alcoholic liver disease combined with other factors, autoimmune liver disease alone, and autoimmune liver disease combined with other factors were presented in 163 (32.6%), 57 (11.4%), 47 (9.4%), 63 (12.6%), 85 (17.0%), and 22 (4.4.0%) cases, respectively. Ascites (221 cases, 44.2%), followed by esophagogastric varices (214 cases, 42.8%), and other including hypersplenism (137 cases), liver cancer (126 cases), upper digestive system tract hemorrhage (66 cases), hepatic encephalopathy (40 cases), infection (37 cases), portal vein thrombosis (23 cases), hepatorenal syndrome (20 cases) were the most common complications. The most common site of infection was the abdominal cavity (20 cases), accounting for 54.1%; followed by respiratory tract infection (8 cases), accounting for 21.6% in patients with liver cirrhosis with concurrent infection. Among them, there were 32 cases of bacterial infection alone, one case of bacterial infection combined with fungal infection, one case of bacterial infection combined with viral infection, and three cases of unknown pathogens. There were 69 cases in Child Pugh grade C, and the average hospitalization times were 12.6 days in terms of prognosis. There were total seven cases of death, of which five cases were due to upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and two due to hepatic encephalopathy. Conclusion: HBV infection, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding were the most common etiologies, complications, and causes of death in patients with liver cirrhosis at our hospital."
31246992,Background and aims: Liver disease in people living with HIV co-infected with hepatitis C virus is a source of morbidity and mortality in Russia. HIV accelerates liver fibrosis in the setting of HCV co-infection and alcohol use. Zinc deficiency is common among people living with HIV and may be a factor that facilitates the underlying mechanisms of liver fibrosis. We investigated the association between zinc deficiency and advanced liver fibrosis in a cohort of HIV / HCV co-infected persons reporting heavy drinking in Russia.

33970396,"Cerebral ischemia / reperfusion (I / R) is known to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, consequences of oxidative stress (OS), and neuronal death in the susceptible brain areas including the cerebellum. Newly, remarkable attention has been paid to a natural diet with the capability to scavenge ROS. Withania coagulans root extract (WCE) is rich in components with antioxidants properties. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of WCE on cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) against OS-mediated apoptosis after I / R injury. In this experimental study 64 male adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 16) as follows: control, sham, I / R, and WCE 1000 + I / R. I / R animals were pretreated with daily administration of hydro-alcoholic WCE (1000 mg / kg) or distilled water as a vehicle for 30 days before I / R injury. After 72 h, the animals were sacrificed, the cerebellum tissue was removed and used for biochemical (CAT, SOD, GPx, and MDA levels) and histopathological (Nissl and TUNEL staining) assays. Findings showed that the MDA level and the number of apoptotic neurons significantly increased and viable Purkinje neurons decreased in I / R injury (p < 0.05). Administration of 1000 mg / kg WCE reduced MDA level and enhanced antioxidants activity including CAT, SOD, and GPx significantly. In addition, intact surviving PCs increased. At the same time, TUNEL-positive neurons decreased significantly in the WCE pre-treated group (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that WCE can counteract cerebral I / R-induced OS and associated neuronal death by enhancement of ROS scavenging and antioxidant capacity. It appears that pre-treatment with 1000 mg / kg WCE for thirty days can protect PCs against OS-mediated apoptosis after I / R injury."

32955203,"Introduction: In alcoholic hepatitis (AH), high interleukin (IL) -22 production is associated with disease improvement, purportedly through enhanced infection resistance and liver regeneration. IL-22 binding protein (BP) binds and antagonizes IL-22 bioactivity, but data on IL-22BP in liver disease suggest a complex interplay. Despite the scarcity of human data, IL-22 is in clinical trial as treatment of AH. We, therefore, in patients with AH, described the IL-22 system focusing on IL-22BP and associations with disease course, and mechanistically pursued the human associations in vitro."

30411754,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide. Blueberry, combined with probiotics (BP), might be a potential candidate for NAFLD treatment, due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Here, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-22, was involved in the therapeutic process of BP, using cell and rat models of NAFLD. Results indicated that BP significantly reduced lipid droplets and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in NAFLD cells. However, when IL-22 was deficient, the lipid droplets and TG content were significantly increased. In vivo, the serum parameters and pathological degree of NAFLD rats were significantly improved by BP, while IL-22 silencing significantly abolished the BP effect. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and western blotting showed that the NAFLD group expressed significantly lower levels of IL-22, JAK1, and STAT3, and higher levels of BAX, than the normal group. Furthermore, BP significantly elevated the levels of IL-22, JAK1 and STAT3, and reduced the level of BAX in NAFLD, while IL-22 silencing prevented BP from restoring the expression of JAK1, STAT3, and BAX. We conclude that IL-22 is vital for the therapeutic effect of BP, and acts via activation of JAK1 / STAT3 signaling and inhibition of the apoptosis factor BAX, which makes IL-22 a promising target for therapy of NAFLD."

31081770,"Pyrexia occurs due to infection, malignancy and other diseases. Majority of the antipyretic drugs are synthetic in nature which exerts side effects such as gastric ulcer, hepatic necrosis and renal damage. The antipyretic potential of the hydro-alcoholic extracts of Achillea millefolium, Taraxacum officinale, Salix alba and Trigonella foenum were investigated on the yeast-induced pyrexia in albino rats. Paracetamol was used as a positive control. Rectal temperature of albino rats was verified immediately before the administration of the extracts or vehicle or paracetamol and yet again at 1-hour gap for 6 hours using a digital thermometer. The animals having pyrexia were divided into four groups Group1: Paracetamol was given to positive control. Group 2: Distilled water was given to negative control. Group 3: (250mg / kg) extract of the plant was given to rats (treatment group 1). Group 4: (500mg / kg) extracts of the plant was given to albino rats (Treatment group 2). The extracts were also phytochemically screened for alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides and phenols. The hydro-alcoholic extracts of plants with the dose of 500mg / kg showed significant (p < 0.0001) decrease in yeast-induced pyrexia, as compared with that of set drug paracetamol (150mg / kg) where the extract dose 250mg / kg was less effective than that of standard drug (p < 0.05). Phytochemical screening showed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins and phenols. This study showed that hydro-alcoholic extracts of all plants under study at a dose of 500mg / kg have significant antipyretic potential in yeast-induced elevated temperature."

37420236,"Background: Oral mucositis (OM), an acute inflammation of the oral cavity, is a common complication in patients undergoing invasive myeloblastic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most effective therapeutic drugs, but one of the common side effects of 5-FU administration is OM. Unfortunately, no suitable treatment has been found, so far to control its side effects. Studies showed that herbal medicine like Punica granatum var pleniflora (PGP) has medicinal properties such as anti-inflammatory and antibacterial and can be an alternative for the treatment of fungal infection. Accordingly, we decided to investigate the therapeutic effect of PGP in the treatment of OM caused by 5-FU in golden hamsters."
32514684,"A 43-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital because of acute left abdominal pain. Chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and a 10-cm pancreatic pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas had been found 5 years previously. He had not stopped drinking alcohol since then. On admission, laboratory tests revealed severe anemia, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed extravasation in the pancreatic pseudocyst. The spleen was retracted by the pancreatic pseudocyst, and its configuration was indistinct. The patient was diagnosed with acute bleeding within the pancreatic pseudocyst and splenic rupture. He was transferred to our university hospital on an emergency basis. Abdominal angiography of the splenic artery was immediately performed, but the bleeding point was not found. Although the bleeding stopped spontaneously, an infection of the pancreatic pseudocyst and a splenic hematoma subsequently developed. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided pseudocyst drainage was performed. The infection improved after the drainage, and the size of the pancreatic pseudocyst and splenic hematoma decreased. Five months later, the pancreatic pseudocyst had almost disappeared, and the splenic hematoma was even smaller. We herein report a rare case of splenic rupture caused by a pancreatic pseudocyst. Although the patient's condition became complicated by severe infection, treatment by endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage was successful."
37455215,"Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. The risk factors associated with the development of HCC are chronic Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and alcoholic cirrhosis. The standard care for HCC is surgical resection but the scope is limited for some patients. Continuous advancement of radiation therapy enabled the technique of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as an option for the treatment of those cases for which surgery cannot be done. According to recent literature and meta-analysis, SBRT is an optimum treatment method with high local control with low toxicity. In SBRT, radiation is delivered with a smaller number of fractions than conventional radiation and employs high-precision delivery and accuracy with the help of image guidance. From a series of retrospective and prospective studies, it has been confirmed that SBRT achieves excellent local control in patients with early-stage inoperable, intermediate-stage, and advanced diseases."

35495021,"Long-term alcohol abuse can cause alcohol-related liver injury (acute alcoholic hepatitis, acute liver failure, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, or cirrhosis), as well as cardiac injury. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a severe consequence of chronic alcohol abuse. Incidence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy ranges from 1-2% of all heavy alcohol users. In the United States, excess alcohol consumption contributes to more than 10% of cases of heart failure. Here, we present a case of a 41-year-old male patient with severe alcohol abuse who presented with signs and symptoms of liver failure and was found to have severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy. More interestingly, the detection of heart failure in this patient was convoluted but also represented an amazing example of how the most basic pathophysiological principles help answer clinical questions in a perplexing scenario. The patient is a 41-year-old Caucasian male with severe alcohol abuse who presented with complaints of diffuse yellowish discoloration of skin, fatigue, and ""feeling not like himself"" for six weeks. A review of systems revealed mild exertional dyspnea and bilateral lower extremity swelling. Physical exam was remarkable for diffuse jaundice involving the whole body, tachycardia, and trace edema in the lower extremity bilaterally. Otherwise, lungs were clear to auscultation, normal heart sounds with regular heart rate and rhythm, no Jugular vein distention, and no carotid bruits were appreciated. Labs showed elevated total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ammonia, and lactate levels. Notably, venous blood gas (VBG) showed metabolic acidosis with compensating respiratory alkalosis with normal potential Hydrogen (pH). An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Treatment was started for acute alcoholic liver failure, with intravenous fluids, intravenous prednisolone, and Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) protocol. The patient's liver function markers went down stably. However, the patient's mental status got worse and his lactate levels continued to rise. He was prescribed empirical antibiotics with a pan Computed tomography (CT) scan to look for any source of infection which revealed no meaningful positive findings. Surprisingly and interestingly, the venous blood gas pH started to trend up demonstrating alkalotic pH which contrasted the initial normal pH on admission. The metabolic acidosis was seemingly ""over-compensated"" by respiratory alkalosis. It was speculated that another underlying pathology existed to count for respiratory alkalosis. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed cardiomegaly but no pneumonia. An echocardiogram showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an Ejection Fraction of 20% and dilated left ventricle. The patient"

37374049,"The use of antivirals, corticosteroids, and IL-6 inhibitors has been recommended by the WHO to treat COVID-19. CP has also been considered for severe and critical cases. Clinical trials on CP have shown contradictory results, but an increasing number of patients, including immunocompromised ones, have shown benefits from this treatment. We reported two clinical cases of patients with prolonged COVID-19 infection and B-cell depletion who showed rapid clinical and virological recovery after the administration of CP. The first patient in this study was a 73-year-old female with a history of follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma previously treated with bendamustine followed by maintenance therapy with rituximab. The second patient was a 68-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bipolar disorder, alcoholic liver disease, and a history of mantellar non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with rituximab and radiotherapy. After the administration of CP, both patients showed a resolution of symptoms, improvement of their clinical conditions, and a negative result of the nasopharyngeal swab test. The administration of CP might be effective in resolving symptoms and improving clinical and virological outcomes in patients with B-cell depletion and prolonged SARS-CoV2 infections."
