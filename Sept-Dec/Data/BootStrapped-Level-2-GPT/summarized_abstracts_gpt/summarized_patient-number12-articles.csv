32484582,"Tricuspid atresia (TA) is a complex congenital heart disease that presents with cyanosis in the neonatal period. It is invariably fatal if left untreated and requires multiple stages of palliation. Early recognition and timely surgical intervention are therefore pivotal in the management of these infants. This literature review considers the pathophysiology, presentation, investigations, and classification of TA. Moreover, it discusses the evidence upon which the latest medical and surgical treatments are based, as well as numerous recent case reports. Further work is needed to elucidate the etiology of TA, clarify the role of pharmacotherapy, and optimize the surgical management that these patients receive."
30337239,"Introduction: Newborns are obligatory nasal breathers. Therefore, nasal obstruction can lead to cyanosis and desaturation. In spite of being very rare, congenital bilateral dacryocystocele is a possible etiology for neonatal respiratory distress. (1) We report a case of bilateral dacryocystocele in a newborn. (2) Case presentation: A newborn male infant was born at term with a birth weight of 2,500 g. (3) He was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with respiratory distress and cyanosis."
30596352,"Common arterial trunk (CAT), or truncus arteriosus, is a rare form of cyanotic congenital heart disease and is highly associated with DiGeorge syndrome (microdeletion 22q11.2). Prenatal diagnosis is highly feasible, allowing proper delivery planning and postnatal management. The clinical presentation is highly variable depending on the anatomical variation; however, most commonly presenting with mild cyanosis and significant tachypnea, although these patients can often go undetected in the immediate newborn period. Transthoracic echocardiography is adequate for diagnosis and detailed anatomical delineation in the majority. Additional imaging modalities such as cardiac catheterization, computed tomography angiography, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in those with more complex pulmonary artery (PA) or aortic anatomy, or in the older repaired. The surgical management of CAT is complete repair in the neonatal period with resection of branch PAs from the CAT with placement of a right ventricular (RV) -to-PA conduit and patch closure of the ventricular septal defect. Overall surgical outcomes are excellent in most centers, with the expectation that the child will eventually outgrow the RV-to-PA conduit and require reoperation. Other potential reoperations or postsurgical interventions in addition to the RV-to-PA conduit may involve the truncal valve or branch PAs."
35987882,"Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) is defined by a constellation of characteristics including micrognathia, glossoptosis and airway obstruction. PRS can occur in isolation or can be associated with syndromes and another anomalies. Airway obstruction and feeding difficulties are the major presenting issues, and the severity of the condition ranges from mild, with minimal to no symptoms, to severe, with overt obstruction resulting in apnoeas, severe respiratory distress and cyanosis. The presence of airway obstruction can result in obstructive sleep apnoea and abnormalities in gas exchange, as well as exacerbation of already present feeding difficulties and failure to thrive, secondary to mismatch of caloric intake to energy usage associated with increased effort of breathing. Management of airway obstruction for infants with PRS varies between centres. This paper explores the surgical and non-surgical management options available, their effectiveness and pitfalls in children with PRS. Despite the pros and cons of each management option, it is evident that resource availability and multidisciplinary clinical support are key factors to successful management."
34173742,"Background: Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) is a lung malformation characterized by overdistension and air trapping in the affected lobe. It is one of the causes of neonatal and infantile respiratory distress. This study aimed to evaluate our experience regarding perioperative and surgical management in children with CLE. (1) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children with CLE who underwent surgical treatment at our institution between January 2010 and December 2017. (2) Results: A total of 13 children (8 males, 5 females) with CLE were included in this study."
36945291,"Ebstein's anomaly is a congenital heart defect characterized by the displacement of the tricuspid valve, and its leaflets to be malformed. Due to the defect involving the tricuspid valve, there is a reverse flow of blood into the right-sided atrium, which may lead to cardiac hypertrophy and edema of the lower extremities. There is a decreased flow of blood out of the right heart due to reduced right ventricular contractility and tricuspid regurgitation. Children afflicted with this anomaly usually suffer from atrial septal defect and this is usually diagnosed before birth on a routine ultrasound scan. In neonates, cyanosis can be seen due to right-to-left atrial shunting or as a result of severe congestive heart failure. If the infant has pulmonary hypertension, cyanosis is markedly increased as there will be a limitation in pulmonary blood flow. In adults, arrhythmias, cyanosis, and heart failure are seen. The bundle of Kent leads to the formation of an electrical conduction abnormality between the right ventricle and atrium. This leads to a condition commonly known as Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome in patients. An enlarged spherical heart is usually present on a chest X-ray. ECG changes of Ebstein's anomaly show taller than usual P waves, PR prolongation, and right bundle branch block. There can be certain neurological and extracardiac manifestations too such as hemiplegia, stroke, dysarthria, etc. During fetal life, specifically at 16 and 20 weeks of gestation, the anomaly can be diagnosed via echocardiography. Prostaglandin infusion (PGE1) is given to maintain pulmonary circulation in neonates if cyanosis is seen. In children and adults with congestive cardiac failure due to this anomaly, medical management includes digoxin, beta-blockers, diuretics, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve heart failure. Surgical treatment includes valve reconstruction. In this article, we review the pathophysiology, genetics, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of Ebstein's Anomaly along with a comprehensive discussion on its genetics, neurological manifestations, extracardiac features, and current advancements in treatment."
32429981,"Background: Congenital lobar overinflation (CLOI) is one of the most important causes of infantile respiratory distress (RD). We aim to evaluate our experience in CLOI management emphasizing on clinical features, diagnostic modalities, surgery and outcomes. (1) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with CLOI who were admitted to our hospital between January 2010 and December 2017. (2) Results: A total of 13 patients (10 males, 3 females) were included in the study."
34847867,"Background: Severe or critical congenital heart defects (CHDs) constitute one third of the heart defect cases detected only after birth. These prenatally unrecognised defects usually manifest as cyanotic or acyanotic lesions and are diagnosed postnatally at various times. The aim of the study was to identify their clinical symptoms and determine individual risk periods for CHD manifestation. (1) Methods: The study included all patients with prenatally diagnosed severe or critical CHD who were referred to the Department of Cardiology, University Hospital of Lodz, Poland, between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015."

37078072,"Background: Truncus arteriosus (TA) or persistent arterial trunk describes the presence of a solitary arterial trunk arising from the base of the heart, supported by a common ventriculoarterial junction. The trunk gives rise to the coronary arteries, systemic arteries, and at least one pulmonary artery. Truncus arteriosus is a rare congenital cardiac disease, and even rarer is the absence of ventricular septal defect. (1) The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and surgical characteristics of patients with TA and ventricular septal defect."
32294011,"Vascular ring malformations usually occur as an isolated lesion. d-Transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) associated with vascular ring malformations has seldom been reported in the literature. In this report, we describe two unusual cases of d-TGA associated with non-Kommerell diverticulum resulting in vascular ring. Our approach for the diagnosis and surgical management of this unusual combination of congenital heart lesions is described. (1) The first case is a 4-month-old girl with d-TGA and d-TGA associated with a vascular ring malformation."
