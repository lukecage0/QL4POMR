26566800,"Background: Associations between vitamin D deficiency and a broad variety of independent diseases, including several bone diseases, various types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, have been suggested. It is therefore important to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency in high-risk groups. Because patients with albinism (PWA) practice a policy of strict sun avoidance, they may be at risk for low levels of vitamin D. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
32256696,"Background: A high proportion of skin cancers in Nigeria occur in Individuals with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). A reduction or absence of melanin, a skin pigment with photoprotective properties, makes them susceptible to skin malignancies such as squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and rarely melanomas. Globally, BCCs are the commonest cutaneous malignancies among Caucasians and in fair-skinned Africans. This has been attributed to the greater effect of melanin in protecting against UV damage in the basal layer of the epidermis. Older retrospective studies on African albinos suggested that SCCs accounted for a higher prevalence of skin cancers in albinos, followed by BCCs. Melanoma has been consistently documented to be rare in all of these reports. Recent reports however noted BCCs to occur at an increasing frequency, suggesting a higher frequency than previously documented. These conflicting reports reflect the need to re-explore the pattern of cutaneous malignancies in albinos in order to reconcile the role of pigmentation, UV exposure and the variance between the frequencies of the different keratinocyte skin cancers among extreme skin phenotypes. This study explores the pattern of cutaneous malignancies seen in albinos in South East Nigeria."
20136908,"Ultraviolet B radiation exposure is responsible for the majority of natural vitamin D stores in humans. The physiologic role of vitamin D in health and disease is continually expanding, and at the same time the population that is vitamin D deficient is increasing. The environmental characteristics and personal physical traits that contribute to vitamin D3 synthesis from sun exposure are discussed, and the effects of photoprotection on vitamin D status are examined. It is concluded that sunscreen, in the manner used by the general public, does not cause vitamin D insufficiency. Implementing guidelines suggesting sun exposure duration for sufficient vitamin D3 production is limited by the complex interaction of contributory factors, and no recommendation can be made that is both safe and accurate enough for general public usage."
9418761,"Background: Although sun protection is advocated for skin cancer prevention, sunlight is also important in generation of vitamin D in the skin. There is concern that sun protection may result in an abnormally low level of vitamin D. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).).

19663879,"Exposure to ultraviolet B radiation in sunlight provides the mechanism for more than 90% of the vitamin D production in most individuals. Concern has been expressed in recent years that the widespread use of sunscreens, particularly those with high sun protection factors, may lead to a significant decrease in solar-induced previtamin D (3) in the skin, resulting in a vitamin D level which is considered insufficient for protection against a wide range of diseases. In this article the published evidence to support and to question this view is presented. It is concluded that, although sunscreens can significantly reduce the production of vitamin D under very strictly controlled conditions, their normal usage does not generally result in vitamin D insufficiency."
35287602,"Background: Racial / ethnic minorities are at higher risk for severe COVID-19. This may be related to social determinants that lead to chronic inflammatory states. The aims of the study were to determine if there are racial / ethnic disparities with inflammatory markers and association of methylprednisolone to in hospital survival. (1) Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020."
33553995,"Vitamin D synthesis by exposure of skin to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) provides the majority of this hormone that is essential for bone development and maintenance but may be important for many other health outcomes. This process, which is the only well-established benefit of solar UVR exposure, depends on many factors including genetics, age, health, and behavior. However, the most important factor is the quantity and quality of UVR reaching the skin. Vitamin D synthesis specifically requires ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation that is the minority component (< 5%) of solar UVR. This waveband is also the most important for the adverse effects of solar exposure. The most obvious of which is sunburn (erythema), but UVB is also the main cause of DNA damage to the skin that is a prerequisite for most skin cancers. UVB at the Earth's surface depends on many physical and temporal factors such as latitude, altitude, season, and weather. Personal, cultural, and behavioral factors are also important. These include skin melanin, clothing, body surface area exposed, holiday habits, and sunscreen use. There is considerable disagreement in the literature about the role of some of these factors, possibly because some studies have been done by researchers with little understanding of photobiology. It can be argued that vitamin D supplementation obviates the need for solar exposure, but many studies have shown little benefit from this approach for a wide range of health outcomes. There is also increasing evidence that such exposure offers health benefits independently of vitamin D: the most important of which is blood-pressure reduction. In any case, public health advice must optimize risk versus benefit for solar exposure. It is fortunate that the individual UVB doses necessary for maintaining optimal vitamin D status are lower than those for sunburn, irrespective of skin melanin. Â© 2020 The Authors.

33546262,"African Americans have higher incidence of, and mortality from, many health-related problems than European Americans. They also have a 15 to 20-fold higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency. Here we summarize evidence that: (i) this health disparity is partly due to insufficient vitamin D production, caused by melanin in the skin blocking the UVB solar radiation necessary for its synthesis; (ii) the vitamin D insufficiency is exacerbated at high latitudes because of the combination of dark skin color with lower UVB radiation levels; and (iii) the health of individuals with dark skin can be markedly improved by correcting deficiency and achieving an optimal vitamin D status, as could be obtained by supplementation and / or fortification. Moderate-to-strong evidence exists that high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and / or vitamin D supplementation reduces risk for many adverse health outcomes including all-cause mortality rate, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, multiple sclerosis, acute respiratory tract infections, COVID-19, asthma exacerbations, rickets, and osteomalacia. We suggest that people with low vitamin D status, which would include most people with dark skin living at high latitudes, along with their health care provider, consider taking vitamin D3 supplements to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to 30 ng / mL (75 nmol / L) or possibly higher."
