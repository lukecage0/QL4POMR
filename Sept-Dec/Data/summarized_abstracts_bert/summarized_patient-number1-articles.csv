ID,Summary
30990294,"Palpable breast masses, mastalgia, and nipple discharge are commonly encountered symptoms in outpatient practice, causing significant patient anxiety and precipitating medical consultation. Targeted ultrasonography localized to discrete areas of the breast can be used alone to evaluate focal breast pain in women younger than 30 years, and as an adjunct to mammography in women 30 years and older."
33178912,"Differently from lactational (milk production) and physiological (white, green, or yellow), which are usually bilateral and involving multiple ducts, pathologic nipple discharge (PND) is a spontaneous commonly single-duct and unilateral, clear, serous, or bloody secretion. Galactography is an invasive technique that may cause discomfort and pain; it can be performed only when the duct discharge is demonstrated at the time of the study, with incomplete/failed examination rate up to 15% and a difficult differentiation between malignant and benign lesions."
32816260,"These changes can give rise to some unique disorders during pregnancy , puerperium and lactation or exaggerate pre-existing conditions. Open incision and drainage of lactational abscess is rarely required, any lactational abscess should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and ultrasound guided aspiration of the pus."
35760711,
36047541,We investigated the value of adding ductography to ultrasound (US) for evaluating pathologic nipple discharge in patients with negative mammography findings.
37733618,"Breast MRI has high sensitivity and negative predictive value, making it well suited to problem solving when other imaging modalities or physical examinations yield results that are inconclusive for the presence of breast cancer. The role of MRI in characterizing calcifications is controversial, and management of calcifications should depend on their mammographic appearance because ductal carcinoma in situ may not appear enhancing on MR images."
33295815,"Because of its high sensitivity in detecting breast malignancy and its biopsy capability, MRI is increasingly used in lieu of ductography. Although central duct excision is the current standard for evaluation of malignancy in patients with pathologic nipple discharge, studies suggest that, given the high negative predictive value of MRI, surveillance may be a reasonable alternative to surgery."
33903276,"It is performed on patients who have pathologic nipple discharge to locate abnormalities in the ducts and guide surgical excision of lesions. This article discusses when and how ductography should be performed, normal and abnormal findings on ductograms, and some conditions commonly diagnosed with ductography."
33846843,Objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI in identifying lesions requiring excision for patients with suspicious nipple discharge but normal mammograms and ultrasounds.
31087408,"Objective: To determine the utility of ductography in conjunction with mammography and ultrasound in patients with pathologic nipple discharge, and the incremental role of MRI after triple-modality evaluation."
32233847,"Introduction: Between 16,000 and 48,000 women are estimated to present to UK breast clinics with nipple discharge each year. The aim of this study was to assess the rate of malignancy in women presenting with unilateral nipple discharge, and to evaluate the role of examination, imaging and cytology in reliably predicting outcome."
32928498,Aim: To correlate solitary dilated ducts (SDDs) detected by mammography with ultrasound and histopathological findings of intraductal lesions and evaluate the association with invasive or in situ breast carcinoma.
31087380,Purpose: To compare sensitivities and specificities of ductography to noninvasive imaging studies in determining the cause of nipple discharge and assess the value of ductography on the basis of pathologic results.
35445176,"Objective: We aimed to investigate mammography (MG), ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of papillary breast carcinoma subtypes and to compare the diagnostic features and performance of the imaging method in distinguishing subtypes."
36436958,"Evidence-based guidelines were used to evaluate breast imaging modalities for appropriateness based on patient age and gender. For males or females 30 to 39 years of age, mammography/DBT or breast ultrasound is performed based on institutional preference and individual patient considerations."
30392596,"However, in the absence any accompanying suspicious clinical finding (eg, lump or nipple discharge), the association with malignancy is very low (0%-3.0%). In cases of pain that is clinically significant (focal and noncyclical), imaging with mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and ultrasound are appropriate, depending on the patient's age."
32072386,"However, histo-anatomical diversities with female breast lead to many differences regarding the frequency and presentation of diseases, the radiologic appearance of lesions, the diagnostic algorithm, and malignity features. This article mainly focuses on emphasizing the results of basic histo-anatomical differences of male and female breasts, classifying male breast lesions, covering the spectrum of male breast diseases, and assisting radiologists in recognizing the imaging findings, in interpreting them through a holistic approach, in making a differential diagnosis, and in being a part of proper patient management."
30559558,"Sarcomas of the breast belong to a heterogeneous group of breast tumors of mesenchymal origin, without epithelial components. For instance, a solitary mass showing rapid growth, with circumscribed or indistinct margins and, a complex (solid-cystic) or heterogeneous echotexture, without axillary lymph node involvement, can raise the suspicion of sarcoma."
37543900,"Background: Nipple discharge is a common finding which may be a symptom of breast cancer, but it is mostly caused by benign causes. A surgical biopsy followed by a histopathological examination is considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of pathological nipple discharge."
32755376,"During pregnancy and lactation, the breast undergoes unique changes that manifest as varied clinical and imaging findings. Understanding the expected physiologic changes of the breast as well as recognizing the best imaging modalities for a given clinical scenario can help the radiologist identify the abnormalities arising during this time."
36900021,"no studies have evaluated whether any clinicopathological or imaging characteristics of breast papillary lesions are associated with pathological nipple discharge (PND). Central location, intraductal nature, hyper/isoechoic pattern, and ductal change were more frequent in the PND group (p = 0.003, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively)."
35415047,Therefore having a background on how to manage is necessary for appropriately identifying and diagnosing the underlying etiology. It can be difficult to identify a source/cause with mammography due to decreased sensitivity with also variable results seen with ultrasound.
36524737,"Twenty patients with pathologic nipple discharge underwent conventional galactography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) galactography. The detective rates of intraductal papilloma by conventional galactography and CEUS galactography were 92.31% and 100%, respectively."
35855197,Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the capabilities of ductography (DG) to navigate stereotactic core-needle biopsy (sCNB) for localizing and differentiating intraductal benign and malignant proliferations of the breast in patients with pathological nipple discharge (PND).
33250296,Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the correlation between presenting clinical symptoms and imaging findings in men with breast cancer.
31352554,Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine the ability of MRI to identify and assess the extent of disease in patients with pathological nipple discharge (PND) with an occult malignancy not evident on standard pre-operative evaluation with mammography and ultrasound.
29768286,Purpose: This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of breast ultrasonography (US) with that of galactography in the detection of lesions in patients with pathologic nipple discharge.
34221643,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a commonly encountered malignancy, accounting for approximately 20% of new breast cancer diagnoses in the United States. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although less readily available than mammography and ultrasound, is advantageous in detecting noncalcified DCIS, especially high grade DCIS, which may not develop microcalcifications."
33074785,"History A 44-year-old woman who was a resident of Bihar, which is a state in eastern India, presented to the surgical outpatient department of our hospital with a history of gradually increasing swelling of the right breast associated with redness, pain, and itching over the past month. no history suggestive of a possible hypercoagulable state could be elicited (she was a nonsmoker, had undergone uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery 15 years earlier, was not taking oral contraceptives, and had no history to suggest past deep venous thrombosis)."
36409422,Background/aims: To investigate the diagnostic performance of breast MRI in revealing mammographically and sonographically occult lesions requiring excision in patients with pathologic nipple discharge.
35169408,"Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is an emerging breast imaging modality that is useful in the evaluation of patients with nipple discharge who have a negative galactogram, especially if they are not good candidates for contrast-enhanced MRI. Given the increasing popularity of CEM in breast imaging practice and its utility in the evaluation of patients with nipple discharge, recognition of retained intraductal contrast as a source of artifact on CEM is important so that steps can be taken to prevent acquiring a limited and/or non-diagnostic CEM."
33180267,"Currently, major duct excision and microdochectomy are often recommended to alleviate symptoms and definitely rule out malignancy, but can cause infections and breastfeeding problems. Ductoscopy is a minimally invasive endoscopy technique that allows visualization of the mammary ducts and may not only obviate surgery but also detect malignancy."
35142103,"Background: Nipple discharge is one of the most common symptoms related to the breast, but it is a presenting feature of breast cancer in 5%-12% of women."
32096789,Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of second-look breast ultrasound (US) immediately after galactography in patients with nipple discharge.
34010034,
30392595,Breast imaging during pregnancy and lactation is challenging due to unique physiologic and structural breast changes that increase the difficulty of clinical and radiological evaluation. Diagnostic breast imaging during pregnancy should be obtained to evaluate clinical symptoms and for loco-regional staging of newly diagnosed PABC.
32008216,"Background: Microdochectomy is the gold-standard for definitive diagnosis for pathological nipple discharge (PND); however, problem of over-treating exists since majority of PND are self-limiting and due to benign causes. This study aimed to evaluate if ductoscopy could reduce unnecessary microdochectomy but not compromising the diagnosis of malignancy."
32748294,Background: Our aim was to compare the diagnostic performance of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)-galactography with that of full-field digital (FFD)-galactography for detecting intraductal breast lesions using an intra-individual design.
32081573,"Introduction: Pathologic nipple discharge (PND) is, after palpable lumps and pain, the most common breast-related reason for referral to the breast surgeon and is associated with breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate (interventional) ductoscopy as an alternative to surgery in patients with negative conventional imaging."
32665191,"Pathologic nipple discharge (PND) is one of the most common breast-related complaints for referral because of its supposed association with breast cancer. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound, mammogram, cytology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ductoscopy in patients with PND, as well as to determine the best diagnostic strategy to assess the risk of malignancy as cause for PND."
32101458,"Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess the outcomes of symptomatic and asymptomatic solitary dilated ducts detected on mammography, ultrasound, and MRI."
31280425,Purpose: To investigate the utility of mammography for breast cancer screening in a population of males at increased risk for breast cancer.
31015391,"Thus far, 5 cases of ruptured epidermal inclusion cysts in subareolar locations have been reported in the English literature. In this case, the clinical presentation of bloody nipple discharge was peculiar; furthermore, mammographic and sonographic features were indistinguishable from breast malignancy or typical breast abscess."
33879660,"To evaluate the clinical and imaging findings of papillary breast neoplasm and review the pathologic correlation at a tertiary center. The presence of mass lesion on mammogram was the most common feature in all 3 papillary lesion groups, and with the presence of asymmetric density, were the 2 mammographic features significantly associated (P < .05) with malignancy."
32822113,The aim of the study is to investigate the intraductal breast papilloma and its coexisting lesions retrospectively in real-world practice.
31587961,"Background: Galactography is a primary recommendation in the management of nipple discharge (ND), which may be caused by benign or malignant lesions."
34010038,
30607630,"Purpose: Patients with spontaneous nipple discharge (SND) who have neither clinically palpable masses nor evidence of disease on imaging with mammogram and/or ultrasound are traditionally investigated with galactogram and duct excision. As breast imaging improves, it has raised the question whether galactography and microductectomy are necessary to diagnose breast cancer."
29402490,Purpose: To evaluate whether in the setting of negative diagnostic mammogram for breast pain additional ultrasound is necessary.
37143645,Common presenting symptoms for intraductal papilloma include serous or serosanguinous nipple discharge or a palpable mass. Diagnostic imaging for the patient included mammography and ultrasound with color doppler imaging that revealed a mass at eight o'clock in the right breast at a distance of 2 cm from the nipple and that corresponded to the area of palpable concern.
37565883,"The etiology of nipple discharge is often unclear, and there are few studies exploring diagnostic approaches of nipple discharge. With respect to high risk diseases, there were 2 (16.7%) patients with atypical intraductal papilloma and 10 (83.4%) with atypical hyperplasia. Combining galactography with other methods is advisable to improve the accuracy of diagnosis in patients with nipple discharge."
32609452,"It is sometimes mistaken for a benign skin condition of the nipple and surrounding areola, which can significantly delay the diagnosis and treatment. We present a rare case of Paget disease of the nipple without the typical characteristics, detected by simple nipple scraping technique."
34219706,"Intracystic papillary carcinoma (IPC) is a rare tumor with good prognosis that occurs in only 5% to 7.5% of male breast cancer. Moreover, radiotherapy should be proposed in the case of conservative surgery, and hormone therapy could be proposed in the case of invasive IPC or IPC associated with a ductal carcinoma in situ."
33857015,"Intraductal assessment of the breast holds the potential to provide useful information regarding breast cancer risk assessment, early diagnosis, and/or response to therapy. The most common nonradiologic approaches to intraductal assessment that provide intraductal fluid for evaluation include breast nipple aspiration fluid (NAF), spontaneous nipple discharge (SND), mammary ductoscopy, and ductal lavage."
33001739,"Purpose: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of Thermalytix, an artificial intelligence-based computer-aided diagnostics (CADx) engine, to detect breast malignancy by comparing the CADx output with the final diagnosis derived using standard screening modalities."
33360004,Purpose: To estimate the upstaging risk of symptomatic ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive disease and to identify features related to upstaging risk.
35751940,"Purpose: As we have previously demonstrated, breast cancers originating in the major lactiferous ducts and propagating through the process of neoductgenesis are a distinct subtype of invasive breast cancers, although by current practice they are placed within the group termed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and are consequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Imaging biomarkers provide a reliable indication of the site of origin of this breast cancer subtype (Ductal Adenocarcinoma of the breast, DAB) and have excellent concordance with long-term patient outcome."
37735939,"Background: The NCCN clinical guidelines recommended core needle biopsy for breast lesions classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4, while category 4A lesions are only 2-10% likely to be malignant. However, it is important to emphasize that the current risk prediction model focuses primarily on the details and complex risk features of US or MG findings, which may be difficult to apply in order to benefit from the model."
33257364,"A 69-year-old man without a family history of breast cancer presented to his primary care physician with a 1-year history of clear, unilateral nipple discharge (ND) without an associated palpable breast mass. His laboratory findings were significant for hyperprolactinaemia at 28 ng/mL. Diagnostic work up including mammography, ultrasound and core needle biopsy ultimately revealed a ductal carcinoma in situ and a rare papillary variant of invasive ductal carcinoma."
35187043,"Papillary neoplasms are a distinct assemblage of breast lesions whose main characteristic is the presence of fibrovascular cores which are surrounded by epithelial cells. EPC is a rare, histologically unique carcinoma type whose main characteristic is a thick fibrous capsule at the periphery and a prolific cell structure with fibrovascular stalk support."
31486176,"Setting: Breast tuberculosis (TB) is rare in Western Europe, and its diagnosis may be delayed through lack of awareness of presenting features."
31743545,"Shunt discontinuity was identified on a diagnostic mammogram, and the nipple discharge was confirmed to be cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)."
34759172,"Objective This study aimed to promote the application of mammography (MMG) screening without performing a clinical breast examination (CBE). To assess the quality of breast cancer screening, process indices were calculated for the overall population, and for patients indicated for close examination based on CBE but not MMG."
30401890,Background: We assessed the association between symptoms reported at breast cancer screening visits and interval cancers (ICs) in a prospective manner.
36897051,"Purpose: Improvements in molecular breast imaging (MBI) have increased the use of MBI as adjunct diagnostic modality and alternative to MRI. We aimed to assess the value of MBI in patients with equivocal breast lesions on conventional imaging, especially in terms of its ability to rule out malignancy."
32477552,"A 62-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to our nationally accredited breast center with bilateral breast masses present for 7 years and new-onset pink nipple discharge for several months. The biopsies revealed benign results, but the discordance between the biopsy, imaging, and suspicious discharge led to the decision to perform bilateral excisional biopsies."
33650727,Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer deaths among women in low-income countries. The aim of this study was to assess how many women self-report a breast abnormality and to determine their diagnoses in rural Ethiopia.
32629735,"Background: Overflow breast disease (OBD), also known as breast nipple discharge, refers fluid or liquid that comes out of nipple."
34304607,"Due to clinical suspicion, a repeat biopsy was performed and revealed scant fragments of papillary carcinoma in a background of inflammation. Therefore, awareness of this unusual feature, repeat biopsy when the pathology result is discordant, and extensive sampling of the lesion are essential for making the correct diagnosis and guiding patient management."
37153030,"Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs), which were first identified in the pleura and later at multiple anatomical locations, are rare mesenchymal neoplasms. Owing to the indolent nature and late recurrence and metastasis of malignant breast SFTs, regular patient follow-up for a longer duration is essential."
35046283,
32156924,"The patient underwent right total mastectomy and was diagnosed with low grade DCIS(ER-positive, PgR-positive, HER2-negative)."
