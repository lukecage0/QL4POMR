ID,Summary
32155645,"Progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been hampered for many reasons. Included among these is the fact that what we are calling ""NEC"" is likely to represent different disease processes, which need to be delineated before evaluating individual pathogenic mechanisms and attempting to develop predictive and diagnostic biomarkers."
31810384,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is the leading cause of death due to gastrointestinal disease in preterm neonates, affecting 5–12% of neonates born at a very-low birth weight. Mortality rates among neonates requiring surgery are estimated to be 20–30%, mandating the development of non-invasive and reliable biomarkers to predict necrotizing enterocolitis before the onset of clinical signs."
31272578,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can involve any aspect of the colon starting with mucosal inflammation in the rectum and extending proximally in a continuous fashion. However, in up to 15% of cases, patients in whom medical therapy fails or who have development of dysplasia secondary to their long-standing colitis will require surgical treatment."
30793842,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an acute inflammatory disease of the intestine which primarily affects preterm infants and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal intensive care unit. From a clinical standpoint, and during the early course of the disease, NEC can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases and conditions common to the preterm infant, and this warrants the need for specific disease biomarkers."
30680646,"Bacterial colonization patterns in preterm infants differ from those of their term counterparts due to maternal microbial diversity, delivery mode, feeding methods, antibiotic use, and exposure to commensal microbiota and pathogens in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Direct administration of probiotics to preterm infants has been shown to reduce the incidence of NEC, but is not without risk."
32085587,"This review aims to discuss the role of nutrition and feeding practices in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), NEC prevention, and its complications, including surgical treatment. There remain significant gaps in knowledge surrounding many of the nutritional aspects of NEC and more research is needed to determine optimal feeding approaches to prevent NEC, particularly in infants younger than 28 weeks and <1000 grams."
30864508,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains the most threatening gastrointestinal complication of prematurity leading to high mortality, morbidity and cost. Common complications of NEC include neurodevelopmental delay, failure to thrive, gastrointestinal problems including strictures and adhesions, cholestasis, short bowel syndrome with or without intestinal failure that can be difficult to manage."
33476530,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating gastrointestinal disease of neonates, especially of preterm infants, with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of NEC are of great significance in improving survival rate and survival quality of neonates."
34654968,"Ultrasound has proved to be a useful modality for enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of necrotizing enterocolitis and associated complications. This article reviews the US features of necrotizing enterocolitis and highlights the role of US as a complement to radiographs, as well as the emerging use of contrast-enhanced US in necrotizing enterocolitis."
30974443,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a relatively common disease in very-low-birth-weight infants and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Analysis of fecal volatile organic compounds, which shape the volatile metabolome and reflect microbiota function and host interaction, has been shown to be of interest in the diagnosis of NEC and late-onset sepsis."
34506326,Objective: The aim of this study was to determine which initial surgical treatment results in the lowest rate of death or neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in premature infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or isolated intestinal perforation (IP).
36328610,"The Necrotizing Enterocolitis Surgery Trial (NEST) highlights the importance of distinguishing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) from spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) when developing surgical treatment plans. Further research is needed to increase the accuracy of this distinction, but even with our current abilities to do this initial laparotomy appears to be optimal for infants with presumed NEC."
31552207,"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a heterogenous and poorly understood entity characterised by an excessive growth of select microorganisms within the small intestine. Risk factors such as acid-suppressive therapies, alterations in gastrointestinal motility and anatomy, as well as impoverished conditions, have been shown to predispose children to SIBO."
30868956,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an acquired severe disease of the digestive system affecting mostly premature babies, possibly fatal and frequently associated to systemic complications. Because of the severity of this condition and the possible long-term consequences on the child's development, many studies have aimed at preventing the occurrence of the primary events at the level of the bowel wall (ischemia and necrosis followed by sepsis) by modifying or manipulating the diet (breast milk versus formula) and/or the feeding pattern (time for initiation after birth, continuous versus bolus feeding, modulation of intake according clinical events)."
32855507,"One of the many challenges with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains our inability to make an accurate diagnosis of NEC. Ongoing studies using single or multi-omic approaches may help to characterize biomarkers that will aid in the prediction or early diagnosis of NEC, as well as differentiate other causes of severe bowel injury."
33664467,"Anemia of prematurity (AOP) is a common condition with a well-described chronology, nadir hemoglobin levels, and timeline of recovery. This review elaborates on the current state of the problem, its implication for the premature infant including association with subphysiologic cerebral tissue oxygenation, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity."
35451633,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and the optimal intervention remains uncertain. no statistically significance was found for the linear regression between mortality and sample size (P = 0.842), gestational age (P = 0.287), birth weight (P = 0.257), sex (P = 0.6). Conclusion: There was no significant difference in mortality between peritoneal drainage and laparotomy as initial surgical intervention."
33498880,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the first cause of short bowel syndrome (SBS) in the neonate, is a serious neonatal gastrointestinal disease with an incidence of up to 11% in preterm newborns less than 1500 g of birth weight. Individualized medical and surgical therapies, as well as intestinal rehabilitation programs, are fundamental in the achievement of enteral autonomy in infants with acquired SBS."

36768793,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening disease that predominantly affects very low birth weight preterm infants. This review summarizes data on prenatal risk factors for NEC, the role of pre-eclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation in the pathogenesis of NEC."
34704805,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is among the most relevant gastrointestinal diseases affecting mostly prematurely born infants with low birth weight. While intestinal dysbiosis has been proposed as one of the possible factors involved in NEC pathogenesis, the role of the gut microbiota remains poorly understood. In particular, dissection of the infant's gut microbiome before NEC diagnosis highlighted the potential involvement of Clostridium genus members in the progression of NEC."
34644520,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a debilitating disease in premature infants resulting from lung injury that disrupts alveolar and pulmonary vascular development. Progress has been made within the last 5 years with the inception of animal models allowing mechanistic investigations into neonatal acute lung injury and alveolar remodeling attributable to endotoxemia and necrotizing enterocolitis.
30384985,"Despite reduction in mortality associated with extreme prematurity, long term pulmonary morbidities remain a concern, with growing recognition of the clinical burden attributable to infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-associated pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite these guidelines, significant practice variation persists and gaps remain with respect to optimal evaluation and management of BPD-associated PH."
35929629,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease that primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract of premature neonates. New biomarkers and potential treatments for NEC have emerged in recent years, leading to the potential of earlier therapeutic intervention and improved outcomes."
34283868,"Background: The relationship between severe anemia, red blood cell transfusion and Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains controversial."
31838477,"The purpose of this review was to summarize evidence from systematic reviews of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) regarding antenatal and postnatal interventions for preventing NEC. Moderate certainty evidence showed a reduction in NEC following administration of a combination of species of probiotics, probiotics (any), antenatal corticosteroids in pregnant women at risk of preterm birth, and ibuprofen versus indomethacin for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)."
37527001,Purpose of review: The purpose of this review is to summarize the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAIs) in premature infants.
34274152,"However, broader connections link the gut and the lungs and these organ systems are tightly interrelated in both homeostasis and disease. In newborns, the most severe gastrointestinal complication of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, and the most severe pulmonary complication, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, both produce significant systemic morbidity."
36383399,"Transfusion-associated necrotising enterocolitis (TANEC) is a life-threatening disease with a poor prognosis in preterm infants. Higher intestinal iron concentration (p < .0001), elevated levels of lipid peroxidation MDA (p = .0021), and ferroptotic mitochondrial morphological changes were found in mice of the anemia-transfusion group; specific ferroptosis inhibitor could alleviate anemia-transfusion gut injury, suggesting that ferroptosis play a role in the TANEC gut injury."
31433747,
33771081,
29695206,"Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral paracetamol versus oral ibuprofen in the treatment of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) in preterm infants. Oral paracetamol was comparable with ibuprofen in terms of the rate of non-surgical ductal closure [28 (93.3%) versus 24 (80%), p = .591]."
35209998,The incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) has overall declined to 15% to 20% of preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g. One of the major complications of severe IVH is posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation (PHVD). Nearly 10% of all infants with IVH and 20% of infants with severe IVH will develop progressive PHVD requiring surgical intervention to prevent parenchymal damage in the developing brain.
30771811,"Diagnosis is particularly challenging, frequently occurring after the disease has progressed to the point of significant and often irreversible intestinal damage. Biomarker research has tremendous potential to advance clinical management of NEC and our understanding of its pathogenesis."
30196017,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a potentially devastating condition that preferentially affects premature and low birth weight infants, with approximately half requiring acute surgical intervention.

35125082,"Although the etiopathogenesis of NEC is unclear, genetic factors may alter a patient's susceptibility, clinical course, and outcomes. To avoid bias in the identification of studies, keywords were short-listed a priori from anecdotal experience and PubMed's Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) thesaurus."
30143341,There is established evidence that providing mother's own breast milk and standardization of feeding regimens leads to a decreased risk for NEC. More recent studies have focused on the provision of donor human milk or an exclusive human milk diet in the endeavor to prevent NEC while still maintaining adequate nutrition to the premature infant.
36653576,Background and aim: A comprehensive understanding of endometriosis and its common gastrointestinal presentations are critical for gastroenterologists to ensure appropriate and timely screening and diagnosis. Endometriosis is a common inflammatory disease that frequently presents with gastrointestinal symptoms overlapping with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other gastrointestinal disorders.
32008132,"There has not been much progress in the prevention or treatment of NEC since it became recognized as a common problem in preterm infants. In this review, we summarize some of the entities that are being called NEC, discuss the pathophysiology of the most classic form of NEC, and provide an overview of how we might proceed in the future to make progress in this field."
35229116,Infants and children often present with common signs and symptoms that may or may not be manifestations of a surgical emergency. This review expands the differential diagnosis of several common presentations to include surgical causes suggesting surgical emergencies and the need for immediate referral to a pediatric surgeon.
35210000,"This is likely due to the lack of a clear understanding of this multifactorial disease, and reliable biomarkers for accurate diagnosis of NEC. Currently, the diagnosis of NEC is made by a combination of nonspecific clinical signs, symptoms, and radiological findings."
37396706,"Viral gastroenteritis is the most common viral illness that affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, causing inflammation and irritation of the lining of the stomach and intestines. Hepatitis viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, herpesvirus 8, and human papillomavirus have been involved in benign and malignant diseases."
30082194,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a devastating surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. This review primarily focuses on recent discoveries: clinical applications of different categories of biomarkers for surveillance, early diagnosis, and predicting severity and prognosis; and understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms as a basis to rationalize the search for 'gut-associated specific biomarkers' of NEC."
37452811,"Description: Belching, bloating, and abdominal distention are all highly prevalent gastrointestinal symptoms and account for some of the most common reasons for patient visits to outpatient gastroenterology practices. Belching and bloating differ in their pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management, and there is limited evidence available for their various treatments."
30145059,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a common morbidity of prematurity, affects 5-10% of premature infants with a birthweight <1500 g. The added cost remains unclear. Multiple studies report the cost of care for an infant with NEC as higher than that of well premature infants, but these studies are fraught with limitations."
34024450,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is a serious and yet incompletely understood gastrointestinal disease of infancy that predominately impacts premature neonates. Although postnatal risk factors have been the focus of prevention efforts, obstetric complications, including intrauterine inflammation and infection, growth restriction, preeclampsia, and prenatal medications, have been associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis."
30771813,The introduction of interrogating bowel with ultrasound when NEC is suspected or when NEC has occurred presents greater opportunity to characterize the physical changes that have occurred in the bowel wall structures. There are current barriers in adoption of these techniques because they have not been integrated into routine diagnostic imaging and are not well incorporated in neonatal medicine.
37368219,"Congenital or genetic causes are more frequent in neonates, while infections, allergy and immune-mediated mechanisms are more frequent in childhood. The approach to a child with chronic diarrhea should be age specific and based predominantly on the pathophysiological mechanism involved."
29980346,"Background/purpose: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of prematurity that develops after feeding, often without warning, and results in diffuse intestinal necrosis leading to sepsis and death in many cases. The lack of improvement in overall survival is influenced by nonspecific diagnostic modalities as well as inexact and nonpersonalized treatment strategies."
34829543,Preterm babies are highly susceptible to oxidative stress (OS) due to an imbalance between the oxidant and antioxidant systems. Many biomarkers have been detected to early identify newborns at risk of developing a free radical-mediated disease and to investigate new antioxidant strategies.

This review provides an overview of the recent researches focused on clinical or experimental NEC and highlights the advances made within the past 5 years toward the development of new potential preventive approaches and therapies for this disease."
36572621,"However, in up to half of the cases, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and failure of medical treatment will require surgical intervention. The following review will discuss the surgical approach to managing NEC, based on an updated review of practice patterns and recently published literature."
30172660,"Although the pathogenesis of NEC is not clear, microbial dysbiosis, with a bloom of the phylum Proteobacteria, has been reported. Microbial metabolites, short chain fatty acids including acetate and butyrate, may modulate immunity, inflammation, intestinal integrity and regulate transcription by epigenetic mechanisms."
32855506,"First classified through Bell staging in 1978, a number of additional definitions of NEC have been proposed in the subsequent decades. In this review, we summarize eight current definitions of NEC, and explore similarities and differences in clinical signs and radiographic features included within these definitions, as well as their limitations."
30771816,"Progressing necrotizing enterocolitis research is difficult because the disease is variable in presentation, there are difficulties in making a precise diagnosis, a reliable agreed case-definition is currently lacking, and there is a paucity of preclinical research to identify etiologic targets. The major challenges of the cost of clinical trials and need for long-term outcome ascertainment could be eased through incorporation of novel randomization approaches and data collection into routine care, and collaboration between public-sector and industry funders."
34836137,"(1) Background: The tolerance of preterm newborns for the high nutritional intakes given by parenteral nutrition (PN) is still debated because of the risk of metabolic complications. 2) Methods: We divided the study sample in two cohorts: 1) Late-Feeding (cohort 1), newborns who received MEF starting from the 8th day of age, and (2) Early-Feeding (cohort 2), newborns who received MEF, consisting of the administration of at least 4-5 mL/kg/day by the enteral route, in the first 7 days of age."
33312348,"Among the currently described exosomes, a majority are potential candidates for the diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Besides, exosomes of human milk have been demonstrated to protect IECs from oxidative stress, stimulate intestinal stem cells activity, improve the proliferation and migration of IECs, and lower the incidence and severity of experimental NEC."

37295298,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal inflammatory disorder, most prevalent in premature infants, and associated with a high mortality rate that has remained unchanged in the past two decades. Preclinical studies by our group have led to the discovery of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) as a promising non-invasive intervention in protecting the intestine against ischemia-induced damage during early-stage NEC."
30499415,"Despite the rise in incidence of NEC there is a scarcity of data regarding long-term outcomes of these infants that can be divided into two groups. The first group includes gastrointestinal complications that could occur in relation to the bowel disease, the surgical treatment and quality of the residual bowel."
34727861,"With the recognition that only 2% of the human genome encodes for a protein, a large part of the ""non-coding"" portion is now being evaluated for a regulatory role in cellular processes. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an inflammatory bowel necrosis affecting preterm infants, has a multifactorial, unclear etiopathogenesis, and we have no specific biomarkers for diagnosis or the impact of directed therapies."
34469367,"Background: Abdominal x-ray (KUB) routinely aids in detecting necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), one of the most serious neonatal intestinal diseases."
33902422,Necrotizing enterocolitis is one of the most frequent and severe gastrointestinal diseases that affect preterm newborns in Neonatal Intensive Care Units.

A total of 20 articles were selected-13 of the articles discussed studies performed in animal models, while 8 used human neonate data."
36621416,"We highlight guidance statements from professional societies and organizations, discussing key points within the context of the currently available evidence from both randomized trials and cohort studies. Finally, we summarize experiences from several north American centers that have reported on the routine use of probiotics, including our center."
36604292,"The recent emergence of multi-omics could potentially shift NEC biomarker discovery, particularly when evaluated using systems biology techniques. Furthermore, the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in analyzing this 'big data' could enable novel interpretations of NEC subtypes, disease progression, and potential therapeutic targets, allowing for integration with personalized medicine approaches."
35241991,We present the case of a breast-fed preterm infant with postnatally acquired cytomegalovirus (CMV) and severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) associated with CMV. The infant had persistent severe thrombocytopenia with clinical deterioration despite multiple platelet transfusions and maximal medical treatment.

30100524,"The specific cause of what is commonly referred to as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) disease has been elusive largely because it is becoming clear that this entity represents more than one disease with multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, finding clear and consistent diagnostic biomarkers will be difficult until the different subsets of what we are calling this disease are better delineated."
31860703,
31238334,"In recent years, several studies have shown that premature infants who develop NEC frequently display enteric dysbiosis with increased Gram-negative bacteria for several days to weeks prior to NEC onset. The importance of these findings, for the possibility of a causal role of these bacteria in NEC pathogenesis, and for potential value of gut dysbiosis as a biomarker of NEC, is well-recognized."
32843076,"Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are serious emergencies in the neonatal period. Although these conditions are recognized as distinct pathologies, literature reports suggest that recurrent episodes of SVT may predispose patients to NEC via disturbances in mesenteric blood flow and a decrease in tissue perfusion."
32615312,"Background: There is no clear consensus on the optimal operative management of premature infants with surgical necrotizing enterocolitis (sNEC) or spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP); thus, a protocol was developed to guide surgical decision making regarding initial peritoneal drainage (PD) versus initial laparotomy (LAP)."
33447301,"The utilization of immunotherapy is increasing to the point of becoming the fifth pillar of management alongside surgical intervention, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy. With the advent of newer immunotherapeutic agents and the consistent approval of current agents by FDA for a wide spectrum of cancers, it is vital for physicians to familiarize themselves with their adverse effects for prompt diagnosis and early intervention to decrease adverse outcomes."
