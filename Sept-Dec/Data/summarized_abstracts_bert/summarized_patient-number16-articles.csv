31864570,"Ischiofemoral impingement is becoming a more recognized source of buttock pain that occurs as the lesser trochanter of the femur approximates the lateral margin of the ischium. Abnormal bony structure and alignment of the hip joint and/or faulty dynamic movement patterns may decrease the ischiofemoral space and compress the structures that are found within the space, including the quadratus femoris, proximal hamstring tendons, and sciatic nerve."
36127925,"The Spondyloarthritis (SpA) represents a group of rheumatic inflammatory entities that share clinical, laboratory and imaging features, including Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). Patients with radiographically axPsA show lower prevalence of inflammatory b ack pain, lumbar and buttock pain in comparison with axSpA. In addition, imaging features differ between axPsA and axSpA, with less sacroiliitis in axPsA and more asymmetrical, chunky syndesmophytes which are predominant at the cervical spine location."
36348684,"Introduction: Most sacroiliac joint (SIJ) disorders are conservatively treated; however, patients with severe pain occasionally require SIJ arthrodesis after failure of continuous conservative management for more than 6 months. We investigated the incidences of preoperative tenderness in the sacrotuberous ligament (STL) and postoperative lower-buttock pain originating from the STL to determine the best way to manage these symptoms to achieve good outcomes."
33559550,"Aggressive angiomyxoma is a rare mesenchymal tumour, primarily arising in the soft tissue of the pelvis and perineum in women of reproductive age. The primary aims of this case report and literature review are to familiarise clinicians with the clinical, histopathological and immunochemical features of these tumours, and to increase appreciation that despite the rarity of aggressive angiomyxoma, it might be considered in the differential diagnosis of ischioanal lesions."

30455493,Background: Pelvic organ prolapse includes descent of anterior/ posterior wall and apical (vault) prolapse with significant morbidity. In this study we evaluated the outcome of sacrospinous ligament fixation of vault through vaginal approach as part of the repair for massive uterovaginal (pelvic organ prolapse stage III and stage IV) and vault prolapse.
35402154,Background: Osteo-articular Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the ischial tuberosity is a rare cause of gluteal pain.
35772982,"Background: The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is affected in 14% to 22% in individuals presenting with chronic low back or buttock pain. When patients do not respond well to nonsurgical treatment, minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion (MISJF) seems to be a reasonable option."
32390565,Introduction: Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is an established treatment for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia in skeletally mature individuals without arthritis.
