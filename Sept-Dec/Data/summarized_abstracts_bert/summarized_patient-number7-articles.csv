ID,Summary
34707048,A 65-year-old man experienced cough and shortness of breath 3 days after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. The timing of the onset of pneumonitis after vaccination and the results of intradermal testing suggest that Type IV hypersensitivity against COVID-19 vaccine may have been responsible for this clinical condition.
32398569,"In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease. Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded."
31491072,"In July 2019, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and the Illinois Department of Public Health received reports of lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarettes (also called vaping) and launched a coordinated public health investigation."
37780871,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus-associated pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were often associated with hyperinflammation and elevation of several serum inflammatory markers but usually less than what is observed in non-coronavirus disease (COVID) ARDS. The second phenotype (hyperinflammatory) had lower platelet count ( p = 0.02), higher serum creatinine ( p = 0.004), higher C-reactive protein ( p = 0.001), higher ferritin ( p < 0.001), and serum lactate dehydrogenase ( p = 0.009)."
32317601,Objectives: The 2015 definition for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome did not require the presence of bilateral infiltrates. We tested the hypothesis that pediatric patients meeting oxygenation criteria for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome but without bilateral infiltrates would have different inflammatory biomarker levels and clinical outcomes than those with bilateral infiltrates.

32970368,"Objective: Adolescent e-cigarette use has risen to epidemic levels in the US, revealing a new phenomenon of e-cigarette vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI).
