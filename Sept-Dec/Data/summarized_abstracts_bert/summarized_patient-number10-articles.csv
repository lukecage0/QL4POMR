33515391,"Background: The risk of sustaining a contra-lateral anterior cruciate ligament (C-ACL) injury after primary unilateral ACL injury is high. C-ACL injury often contributes to a further decline in function and quality of life, including failure to return to sport."
35896233,
34209445,"Blount's disease is an idiopathic developmental abnormality affecting the medial proximal tibia physis resulting in a multi-planar deformity with pronounced tibia varus. When non-operative treatment fails the deformities progress through skeletal maturity and can result in pain, gait abnormalities, premature medial compartment knee arthritis, and limb length discrepancy."
31466661,"Development of PTA is multifactorial and results from mechanical damage at the time of trauma, a cell-mediated inflammatory response, and abnormal articulation due to persistent malalignment or joint instability. Although some risk factors may be unavoidable, preventing the development of PTA of the knee after intra-articular fracture (IAF) requires restoring anatomic articulation and alignment."

31165193,We report a case of a 16-year-old boy who presented a soft-tissue mass in the anterior compartment of the right thigh discovered by positron emission tomography/computed tomography within the work-up of unexplained prolonged inflammatory syndrome. Adjacent thick fascia enhancement of the vastus intermedius and the vastus lateralis muscles extending from the mass as a tail-like margin suggested the infiltrative spread of the tumor along the fascial plane.
33482754,"Background: Small soft tissue masses are often falsely assumed to be benign and resected with failure to achieve tumor-free margins. Therefore, this study retrospectively investigated the distribution of histopathologic diagnosis to be encountered in small soft tissue tumors (â‰¤ 5 cm) in a large series of a tertiary referral center."

30817419,"Objective: In the 50 years since a premature partial physeal arrest (a physeal bar) was first excised from an epiphysis there have been no large in-depth studies reporting the results in patients followed to skeletal maturity. This paper reports the results of physeal bar resection surgery in a group of patients followed to skeletal maturity, documenting the restored growth of the affected physis, the affected bone, and the final limb-length discrepancy."
32950242,"They spread mostly sporadically (90%) and therefore are rarely associated to an underlying constitutional genetic disease (10%). However, predictive value of imaging exams still remains imperfect, and histological analysis by percutaneous image-guided biopsy and sometimes by surgical biopsy is often necessary."
35667602,"Although decreased bone formation can be seen at diagnosis, the underlying pathophysiology of suboptimal bone accrual remains poorly understood. Additional studies are needed to evaluate bone marrow composition in these patients and to elucidate further the inverse relationship between marrow adipocytes and osteogenesis, as well as the relationship between bone marrow adiposity and body composition."

37835554,"Synovial sarcomas are rare and highly aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas, primarily affecting adolescents and young adults aged 15-40 years. Nevertheless, the existence of non-aggressive features, such as gradual growth (with an average time to diagnosis of 2-4 years) and small size (initially measuring < 5 cm) with well-defined margins, can lead to an initial misclassification as a benign lesion."
31425335,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the complication rate and outcome after implementation of these changes. Despite a lower threshold for surgery for distal femur physeal fractures in the past decade, the complication rate is still high and unchanged at 40%, and presenting patients are older."
34176365,Extra-axial chordomas in the pediatric population are extremely rare and diagnostically challenging; only four cases have been previously reported with ages ranging from 13 to 20 years. Extra-axial chordomas share the same histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics with their axial counterparts and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any extra-axial bone or soft tissue mass with epithelioid morphology.

Patients with TD had smaller external rotation of the distal femur (2.69Â±0.93) compared to the control group (3.77Â±1.46) (P<0.01).
33635286,"Background: Large, malignant bone tumors and revision limb salvage procedures often result in the resection of extensive lengths of the involved bone segment, leaving a residual segment of bone that may be too short to support a standard intramedullary stem for endoprosthetic reconstruction. Telescope allografting, in which an allograft is used to augment the remaining bone segment by telescoping it into the residual bone segment, was described for situations in which residual bone stock is insufficient after tumor resection or prosthetic revision."
