ID,Summary
26566800,"Background: Associations between vitamin D deficiency and a broad variety of independent diseases, including several bone diseases, various types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, have been suggested. Because patients with albinism (PWA) practice a policy of strict sun avoidance, they may be at risk for low levels of vitamin D."
32256696,"A reduction or absence of melanin, a skin pigment with photoprotective properties, makes them susceptible to skin malignancies such as squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and rarely melanomas. These conflicting reports reflect the need to re-explore the pattern of cutaneous malignancies in albinos in order to reconcile the role of pigmentation, UV exposure and the variance between the frequencies of the different keratinocyte skin cancers among extreme skin phenotypes."
20136908,"The physiologic role of vitamin D in health and disease is continually expanding, and at the same time the population that is vitamin D deficient is increasing. The environmental characteristics and personal physical traits that contribute to vitamin D3 synthesis from sun exposure are discussed, and the effects of photoprotection on vitamin D status are examined."
9418761,"Background: Although sun protection is advocated for skin cancer prevention, sunlight is also important in generation of vitamin D in the skin."
19663879,"Exposure to ultraviolet B radiation in sunlight provides the mechanism for more than 90% of the vitamin D production in most individuals. Concern has been expressed in recent years that the widespread use of sunscreens, particularly those with high sun protection factors, may lead to a significant decrease in solar-induced previtamin D(3) in the skin, resulting in a vitamin D level which is considered insufficient for protection against a wide range of diseases."
35287602,The aims of the study were to determine if there are racial/ethnic disparities with inflammatory markers and association of methylprednisolone to in hospital survival.
33553995,"Vitamin D synthesis by exposure of skin to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) provides the majority of this hormone that is essential for bone development and maintenance but may be important for many other health outcomes. It is fortunate that the individual UVB doses necessary for maintaining optimal vitamin D status are lower than those for sunburn, irrespective of skin melanin."
33546262,"Here we summarize evidence that: (i) this health disparity is partly due to insufficient vitamin D production, caused by melanin in the skin blocking the UVB solar radiation necessary for its synthesis; (ii) the vitamin D insufficiency is exacerbated at high latitudes because of the combination of dark skin color with lower UVB radiation levels; and (iii) the health of individuals with dark skin can be markedly improved by correcting deficiency and achieving an optimal vitamin D status, as could be obtained by supplementation and/or fortification. Moderate-to-strong evidence exists that high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and/or vitamin D supplementation reduces risk for many adverse health outcomes including all-cause mortality rate, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, multiple sclerosis, acute respiratory tract infections, COVID-19, asthma exacerbations, rickets, and osteomalacia."
