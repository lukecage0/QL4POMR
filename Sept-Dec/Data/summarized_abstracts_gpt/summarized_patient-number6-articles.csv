36049847,"Preeclampsia (PE) is the most common complication of pregnancy. PE is a multisystem disorder that can result in maternal morbidity and mortality. A severe complication of PE is the HELLP syndrome. HELLP syndrome is a pregnancy-associated liver disease characterized by the presence of hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. Management of HELLP syndrome includes monitoring of obstetric complications, controlling hypertension, seizure prevention, and planning for delivery. Also, postpartum care of the mother and the newborn should focus on physiologic and emotional wellbeing."
30908805,"Cholelithiasis affects approximately 15% of the US population. Rising trends in obesity and metabolic syndrome have contributed to an increase in diagnosis of cholelithiasis. There are several risk factors for cholelithiasis, both modifiable and nonmodifiable. Women are more likely to experience cholelithiasis than are men. Pregnancy, increasing parity, and obesity during pregnancy further increase the risk that a woman will develop cholelithiasis. The classic presentation of persons experiencing cholelithiasis, specifically when gallstones obstruct the common bile duct, is right upper quadrant pain of the abdomen that is often elicited upon palpation during physical examination and documented as a positive Murphy's sign. Referred pain to the right supraclavicular region and / or shoulder, nausea, and vomiting are also frequently reported by persons with cholelithiasis. Cholelithiasis can result in complications, including cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) and cholangitis (inflammation of the bile duct). Lack of physical examination findings does not rule out a diagnosis of cholelithiasis. Laboratory tests such as white blood cell count, liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase may assist the clinician in diagnosing cholelithiasis; however, ultrasonography is the gold standard for diagnosis. Management is dependent on severity and frequency of symptoms. Lifestyle and dietary modifications combined with medication management, such as use of gallstone dissolution agents, may be recommended for persons who have a single symptomatic episode. If symptoms become severe and / or are recurrent, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended. It is recommended that individuals with an established diagnosis of cholelithiasis be referred to a surgeon and / or gastroenterologist within 2 weeks of initial presentation regardless of severity or frequency of symptoms."
35276220,"The liver disorders unique to pregnancy include hyperemesis gravidarum, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and preeclampsia-associated hepatic impairment, specifically hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome (HELLP). Their importance lies in the significant maternal and fetal / neonatal morbidity and mortality. Expeditious diagnosis and clinical evaluation is critical to ensure timely, appropriate care and minimize risks to the pregnant woman and her fetus / baby. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, including midwives, maternal-fetal-medicine specialists, anesthetists, neonatologists, and hepatologists."
30000851,"Coriander (Coriandrum sativum) seeds contain a volatile oil, consisting mainly of linalool, which is responsible for its odor and taste. It also contains 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol). Coriander is a purported galactogogue, and has been included in some mixtures promoted to increase milk supply; [1,2] however, no scientifically valid clinical trials support this use. Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production. [1,3] Coriander is ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS) as a food by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, allergic reactions and photosensitivity have been reported and it can cause contact dermatitis. One case of excessive use possibly caused endocrine disruption in a nursing mother. A woman nursing her 10-month-old infant had drunk 200 mL of about a 10% aqueous extract of Coriandrum sativa (method of verification and possible presence of contaminants not stated) daily for 7 consecutive days to enhance her milk supply when she was admitted to the hospital with severe diarrhea and stomach pain. The patient had no abnormal serum or urine tests and recovered with palliative therapy. Fifteen days later the patient was complaining of skin darkness, depressed mood, a loss of body fluids, and amenorrhea, which was diagnosed as an adrenal dysfunction. The patient said that she did not have any history of such a condition. She was treated with adrenocorticoids and an oral contraceptive. She was well and healthy 10 days later. [2] Elevated liver enzymes occurred in a woman taking Mother's Milk Tea, which contains coriander. [4] The patient was treated with prednisone and recovered."
30000835,"Anise (Pimpinella anisum) seeds contain anethole, which is a phytoestrogen. Anise is a purported galactogogue, [1-6] and is included in some proprietary mixtures promoted to increase milk supply; however, few scientifically valid clinical trials support this use. Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production. [7,8] Maternal anise ingestion reportedly imparts an odor to breastmilk, [9] possibly because anethole is excreted into breastmilk. [10] Anise is ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS) as a flavoring by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Elevated liver enzymes occurred in a woman taking Mother's Milk Tea, which contains anise. [11] Excessive maternal use of an herbal tea containing anise and other herbs appeared to cause toxicity in two breastfed newborns, consistent with toxicity caused by anethole."
32220159,"The term porphyria comes from the Greek porphyra. It refers to a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders caused by the enzymatic deficiency in the biosynthesis of the heme group. Acute intermittent porphyria is caused by a deficiency of the porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme. A 40-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain for ten days (which required laparotomy that evidenced no surgical pathology), severe hydroelectrolytic disorder due to hyponatremia and resistant hypokalemia, persistent tachycardia and hypertension. Seven days later, she developed acute flabby quadriparesis and presented a single generalized tonic-clonic convulsive crisis. Neurophysiological studies supported mixed axonal polyneuropathy and urine results of porphobilinogen and porphyrins were elevated. After acute intermittent porphyria was diagnosed, hemin was administered, which stabilized the patient s clinical signs and normalized the porphobilinogen. The prevalence of this entity is 1 in 2,000 people. It is an autosomal dominant disease, which affects mainly women between 20 and 40 years of age. This entity manifests with neurological and visceral symptoms. Management consists of hematin and dextrose administration avoiding hypotonic solutions because of the risk of exacerbating hyponatremia."
34918633,"Background: Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a common cause of acute abdominal pain in the field of gynecology. Because the majority of women with EP are hemodynamically stable, non-surgical therapy is a viable option. The goal of this study was to determine the most effective non-surgical therapy for hemodynamically stable EP. (1) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of women with EP who were hemodynamically stable and underwent non-surgical therapy at a single institution from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015."
30000834,"Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus, Carduus benedictus, Cardui benedicti) contains sesquiterpene lactones, triterpenoids, lignans, tannins, essential oils, flavonoids, and polyenes. Blessed thistle is a purported galactogogue, [1-6] and is included in some proprietary mixtures promoted to increase milk supply; however, no scientifically valid clinical trials support this use. Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production. [7,8] Blessed thistle is ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS) as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages (e.g., Benedictine) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Because it is a member of the ragweed family, allergy is a concern and high doses reportedly cause stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting. Elevated liver enzymes occurred in a woman taking Mother's Milk Tea, which contains blessed thistle and other ingredients. [9] The manufacturer of Mother's Milk Tea has recommended that the product be labeled as ""safe"" and that it be used with caution in lactating women."
35727713,"A 45-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with acute worsening of prolonged unexplained nausea, nonbilious vomiting, and mild upper abdominal pain of 4 years duration. Her bowel habits were regular, and there was no history of diarrhea or fresh or altered blood in her stool. On further inquiry, there was no history of facial flushing, excessive diaphoresis, or asthmalike symptoms. Her history was unrevealing; in particular, there was no history of known malignancy. On clinical examination, her vital signs were stable. The abdomen was soft, with no focal tenderness or palpable mass. Routine blood investigations, including complete blood counts, and liver, kidney, and thyroid function tests yielded results that were within normal limits. Her 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and chromogranin A levels were not elevated. Initial evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. Subsequently, an indium 111 octreotide scan was performed at the recommendation of the radiologist 1 month after CT (Figs 1, 2)."
37376945,"Background: Liver abscess caused by foreign bodies constitutes a rare medical problem that few of us will encounter in a clinical setting. (1) The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of liver abscess caused by foreign bodies. (2) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with liver abscess caused by foreign bodies from January 2000 to December 2016. (3) Results: A total of 12 patients were included in this study."
30399096,Background: Retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancies are rare and have a tendency to implant along major vessels of the abdomen and pelvis. Clinical manifestations can vary from no symptoms to hypovolemic shock and death. (1) The diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific symptoms and nonspecific laboratory findings. (2) The treatment is surgical. (3) The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancies. (4) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancies who were treated at our institution from January 2010 to December 2017.
34806684,"Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic, non-caseating granulomatous disorder with an idiopathic aetiology. We report a 58-year-old Malay woman, with underlying type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension and history of stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis presenting with incidental finding of multiple hypodense liver lesions. Her recent contrasted enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies with evidence of liver and splenic infiltrations. Her ageappropriate malignancy screening was negative while liver biopsy showed non-caseating granulomatous hepatitis consistent with hepatic sarcoidosis. In view of her normal liver enzymes and normalised serum calcium levels, no immunosuppressive therapy was commenced. She remains asymptomatic and is currently under our close monitoring."
35015414,"Preeclampsia, formerly called toxemia of pregnancy, is a disorder that affects pregnant women, most commonly in their third trimester. Characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, it can involve nearly every organ system and often results in significant end-organ dysfunction. Preeclampsia is relatively common in pregnancy, affecting up to 3 to 8% of pregnancies worldwide. (1) It is associated with a high rate of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. (2) The pathophysiology of preeclampsia is complex and involves a number of factors, including genetic predisposition, maternal and fetal immune dysregulation, and placental dysfunction."

32662343,"Adnexal masses are rare in the young female population. The differential diagnosis includes ovarian masses, tubal / paratubal masses, masses related to the gastrointestinal tract (colon), infectious lesions, or pregnancy. Acute abdominal pain, and less commonly, precocious puberty or vaginal bleeding, are typical symptoms in these cases. The majority of adnexal masses in the paediatric and adolescent population are benign; however, a thorough preoperative assessment is essential to guide surgical intervention and optimise patient outcomes. The proper diagnosis of an adnexal mass, correct management (surgical or nonsurgical), and necessary referrals are of paramount importance. In the light of these cornerstones, this review describes the aetiologies, presenting symptoms, and appropriate diagnostic work-up for paediatric and adolescent patients affected by adnexal masses."
36902633,"In modern clinical practice, there is an increasing dependence on imaging techniques in several settings, and especially during emergencies. Consequently, there has been an increase in the frequency of imaging examinations and thus also an increased risk of radiation exposure. In this context, a critical phase is a woman's pregnancy management that requires a proper diagnostic assessment to reduce radiation risk to the fetus and mother. The risk is greatest during the first phases of pregnancy at the time of organogenesis. Therefore, the principles of radiation protection should guide the multidisciplinary team. Although diagnostic tools that do not employ ionizing radiation, such as ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be preferred, in several settings as polytrauma, computed tomography (CT) nonetheless remains the examination to perform, beyond the fetus risk. In addition, protocol optimization, using dose-limiting protocols and avoiding multiple acquisitions, is a critical point that makes it possible to reduce risks. The purpose of this review is to provide a critical evaluation of emergency conditions, e.g., abdominal pain and trauma, considering the different diagnostic tools that should be used as study protocols in order to control the dose to the pregnant woman and fetus."
36033249,"A thirty-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to hospital with headache and gastrointestinal discomfort. She developed peripheral oedema and had an emergency caesarean section following an episode of tonic-clonic seizures. Her delivery was further complicated by postpartum haemorrhage and she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further resuscitation and seizure control which required infusions of magnesium and multiple anticonvulsants. Despite haemodynamic optimisation she developed an acute kidney injury with evidence of liver damage, thrombocytopenia and haemolysis. Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome, a multisystem disease of advanced pregnancy which overlaps with pre-eclampsia, was diagnosed. HELLP syndrome is associated with a range of complications which may require critical care support, including placental abruption and foetal loss, acute kidney injury, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, acute liver failure and liver capsule rupture. Definitive treatment of HELLP is delivery of the fetus and in its most severe forms requires admission to the ICU for multiorgan support. Therapeutic strategies in ICU are mainly supportive and include blood pressure control, meticulous fluid balance and possibly escalation to renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, neuroprotection, seizure control, and management of liver failure-related complications. Multidisciplinary input is essential for optimal treatment."
31490823,"A healthy 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of sudden-onset severe lower abdominal pain. This is her first episode. She reports nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Her last colonoscopy was at age 60, and was normal, except for diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Physical examination is significant for fever, tachycardia, and generalized abdominal pain with rebound tenderness. Pertinent laboratory findings include a leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A CT scan is obtained and is consistent with freely perforated diverticulitis, including a thickened sigmoid colon, free fluid in the pelvis, and free air noted near the diaphragm (). The surgeon completes the patient evaluation, recommends initiation of intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, and plans to go immediately to the operating room for surgical resection."
34049966,"Introduction: Abdominal pain and distention are common in ovarian tumours. When the ovarian tumour grows too large, the tumour can cause these symptoms. Percutaneous drainage from ovarian tumours, which can alleviate symptoms, is traditionally discouraged for its potential risk of peritoneal tumour seeding. (1) We report our experience with percutaneous drainage of ovarian tumours. (2) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent percutaneous drainage of ovarian tumours at our institution between January 2010 and December 2017."
36177063,"Recommended management of patients with preeclampsia starts with a comprehensive clinical maternal and fetal evaluation, including maternal complete blood count, platelets, creatinine, LDH, liver enzymes, and urine test for proteinuria, along with fetal ultrasonographic evaluation and fetal antepartum testing.7 Subsequent management depends on the results of this evaluation and on gestational age. Continued observation is recommended for a woman with a preterm fetus if she has gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features, until delivery at 37 weeks of gestation in the absence of abnormal antepartum testing, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, or vaginal bleeding.7 There are numerous conditions precluding such expectant management including severe hypertension refractory to treatment, persistent headaches refractory to treatment, epigastric or right upper pain refractory to treatment, visual disturbances, motor deficit, altered sensorium, stroke, myocardial infarction, new or worsening renal dysfunction, pulmonary edema, suspected acute placental abruption, vaginal bleeding in the absence of placenta previa, eclampsia, or HELLP syndrome.7. The management of patients with preeclampsia is complicated by the fact that the condition is often asymptomatic and that the condition is often diagnosed late in pregnancy."
31565446,"Menotrophin is a protein-based hormonal therapy. It is used as a fertility medication that is given as injection either subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Menotrophin has not been previously reported to cause drug-induced liver injury. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is commonly seen nowadays with the expansion of the drug industry. It is associated with prescribed medications, over the counter drugs, herbal and dietary supplements. We report the first case of Menotrophin-induced autoimmune hepatitis in a 26-year-old Caucasian woman who was diagnosed with primary infertility due to failure to conceive after five years of marriage. She had received several cycles of Menotrophin, then developed new onset jaundice and fatigue associated with increase in transaminases. She had normal baseline liver function and enzymes prior to receiving treatment with Menotrophin. Evaluation showed no evidence of viral hepatitis, metabolic, alcoholic or vascular causes of liver injury. Autoimmune screening was positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA) with titer of 1: 640 fine speckled, immunoglobulin G (IgG) level was 1900 mg / dl. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and antismooth muscle antibodies were negative. Liver biopsy showed features of chronic hepatitis with interface hepatitis and prominence of plasma cells, which best reflects autoimmune hepatitis. Her liver enzymes and bilirubin completely normalized after discontinuation of further Menotrophin therapy and starting treatment with prednisolone and Azathioprine."
35821899,"Splenic infarction can occur as an infrequent thrombotic manifestation in polycythaemia vera (PV) and is usually catastrophic. We describe the case of a middle-aged woman who was diagnosed with PV 3 months before she presented to the emergency department with acute limb ischaemia. A splenic infarction detected on diagnostic imaging during her hospital stay was treated conservatively with modification of her hydroxyurea dose along with pain management, without the need for surgery.

36447734,"Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) and aeroportia have been rarely described in hemodialysis patients. We present a case of a 64-year-old woman on regular hemodialysis who presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Abdominal CT showed pneumatosis intestinalis and aeroportia suggestive of ischemic abnormalities. In this case, given the absence of transmural necrosis or bowel perforation, aeroportia seemed to be caused by nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (noMI), an increasingly recognized complication in hemodialysis patients. The patient was proposed for emergent exploratory laparotomy; however, she had a fatal outcome. Hemodialysis-dependent patients should be considered at risk of the ""low-flow syndrome"" of mesenteric arterial circulation. Prevention is crucial, and early detection of these entities is important for prompt diagnosis and management of mesenteric ischemia."
31913959,"Women with irritable bowel syndrome often report fatigue, along with abdominal pain and psychological distress (i.e., depression and anxiety). There is little information about the relationships among these symptoms. Using a secondary data analysis (N = 356), we examined the relationship between abdominal pain and fatigue and whether psychological distress mediates the effect of abdominal pain on fatigue in both across women and within woman with irritable bowel syndrome. Data gathered through a 28-day diary were analyzed with linear regressions. The across-women and within-woman relationships among same-day abdominal pain, fatigue, and psychological distress were examined. Within-woman relationships were also examined for directionality among symptoms (i.e., prior-day abdominal pain predicts next-day fatigue and prior-day fatigue predicts next-day abdominal pain). In across-women and within-woman analyses on the same day, abdominal pain and fatigue were positively correlated. In within-woman analyses, abdominal pain predicted next-day fatigue, but fatigue did not predict next-day pain. In across-women and within-woman analyses, psychological distress partially mediated the effects of abdominal pain on fatigue. Symptom management incorporating strategies to decrease both abdominal pain and psychological distress are likely to reduce fatigue. Nursing interventions, such as self-management skills to reduce abdominal pain and psychological distress, may have the added benefit of reducing fatigue in irritable bowel syndrome."

31227569,"Annular pancreas (AP) is a rare diagnosis in the adult population but can cause significant morbidity if not correctly identified. In adults, the most common symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. While these are not specific to AP, they are important clues to this diagnosis in the right clinical context. We present the case of a 24-year-old woman presenting with a 6-year history of progressive abdominal pain and dyspepsia in the context of an extensive negative workup. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series and MRI revealed partial duodenal obstruction, concerning for AP. While patients with chronic abdominal pain and vague GI complaints may be diagnosed with functional bowel disorders, it is important to appropriately address the possibility of an underlying structural lesion such as AP. This strategy is not only cost-effective but also saves the patient discomfort associated with unnecessary procedures and allows a timely intervention."
33619144,"A 61-year-old woman with no significant previous medical history presented to an urgent care facility with generalised rash, flushing and abdominal pain after eating mahi-mahi. She was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and discharged home. Later she experienced severe acute abdominal pain and multiple episodes of vomiting, which prompted her to go to the hospital. On admission, the patient had an elevated white count, lipase, amylase and C reactive protein with normal liver enzymes and bilirubin. Imaging showed acute pancreatitis that was suspected to be secondary to scombroid poisoning. This was confirmed by elevated immunoglobulin E and histamine levels. The acute pancreatitis was treated with pain management and supportive treatment. Scombroid poisoning is a well-recognised disease, however, acute pancreatitis secondary to this is rare as only two cases have been reported in the literature, one with codfish and the second an unknown type of fish."
34623978,"BACKGROUND Intussusception is a rare pathological entity in adults and remains a diagnostic challenge for clinicians, as it shares many clinical signs and symptoms with other morbid conditions (including appendicitis, abdominal hernias, colic, volvulus, and Meckel diverticulum). High clinical suspicion and use of appropriate imaging techniques are essential for early diagnosis and treatment of intussusception. Surgical intervention is the treatment of choice in cases of sustained and persistent invagination. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 65-year-old woman with a medical history of Crohn's disease, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was hospitalized for diarrhea, fatigue, and anemia. Computerized tomography of the abdomen and a colonoscopy revealed telescoping of the ileum, ileocecal valve, and part of the ascending colon inside the terminal segment of the ascending colon. The antegrade ileocolic intussusception was treated by performing a right hemicolectomy. The pathologic examination of the excised intestine showed mucosal lesions compatible with Crohn's disease, an inflammatory fibroid polyp at the terminal section of the ileum, and a low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS Regardless of the etiology, when the normal motility of the intestine is altered, it can lead to invagination. Although intussusception is rare, it must always be part of the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with constant abdominal pain."
36381720,"Liver disease is one of the possible clinical manifestations of common variable immunodeficiency and can range from mild hepatomegaly and persistent elevation of liver enzymes to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia. The last one is the most common histologic presentation of liver involvement by common variable immunodeficiency and its clinical spectrum can range from asymptomatic to cholestasis, liver cirrhosis, or idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, with the severe manifestations being less recognised. We present a case of a 48-year-old woman who was referred for an internal medicine consultation for evaluation of rapidly progressing (span of three months) large-volume ascites and marked asthenia. The patient had a past medical history of common variable immunodeficiency and a recent episode of severe haemolytic anaemia. Peritoneal fluid analyses identified portal hypertension as the cause of the ascites. Abdominal Doppler ultrasound and contrasted abdominal computed tomography confirmed the presence of permeable hepatic and portal veins. Liver biopsy revealed regenerative nodular hyperplasia without cirrhosis. A diagnosis of idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension secondary to common variable immunodeficiency was made. Treatment was adjusted with considerable improvement in ascites. In conclusion, idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension is a possible and often overlooked complication in patients with common variable immunodeficiency and is an exclusion diagnosis that requires a high level of suspicion, especially in patients with ascites."
33224397,"Lymphangioma is a rare, benign congenital malformation of the lymphatic system that usually affects the neck and head in children. Intra-abdominal lymphangioma accounts for less than 5 percent of all cases of lymphangioma. The clinical presentation of intra-abdominal lymphangioma can vary from asymptomatic to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of intra-abdominal lymphangioma is based on imaging modalities and histopathological examination. The definitive treatment is surgical resection. Here we describe the interesting and rare case of a 29-year-old woman with lymphangioma of the retroperitoneum extending to the root of the mesentery. We focus on the diagnosis and management of this rare tumor by the application of radiological modalities and pathological analysis."
37435108,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by diverse clinical manifestations and a broad spectrum of disease course and prognosis. Often presenting over an extended period, delays in diagnosis can significantly influence patient management and survival, particularly when faced with rare complications such as digestive system manifestations. This case report uniquely highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by severe abdominal pain in a young woman suspected of SLE, with a symptom often masked by steroid therapy or immunosuppression. The diagnostic journey, which led to the identification of SLE as the cause of abdominal pain, involved differentiating SLE from various abdominal pathologies including abdominal vasculitis, gastrointestinal syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, pancreatitis, urinary tract infections, and obstetric-gynecological abnormalities. This case underlines the critical need for accurate, timely diagnosis, and targeted therapy in managing SLE, emphasizing the potential implications of such complexities on patient outcomes."
35861278,"Elevated calcitonin and catecholamine levels in patients with adrenal masses and thyroid nodules are suspicious for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. Here, we present an interesting case with elevated catecholamines, thyroid nodules, and hypercalcitoninemia. A 46-year-old woman with complaint of abdominal pain was recently hospitalized. Abdominal computed tomography elicited a 7 cm left adrenal mass. Upon presentation to our clinic, the patient complained of abdominal pain, nausea, and diaphoresis. Laboratory studies showed elevated catecholamines, and a pheochromocytoma was subsequently diagnosed. Further evaluation elicited elevated calcitonin levels and a suspicious 3 cm left thyroid nodule, inciting concern for medullary thyroid carcinoma. The patient underwent an uneventful robot-assisted laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. Surgical pathology confirmed a pheochromocytoma. Post-operative calcitonin levels resolved to within normal range. The patient elected to undergo a left hemithyroidectomy. Surgical pathology confirmed calcitonin-negative nodular hyperplasia, negative for malignancy. The patient's diagnosis was confined to a pheochromocytoma. Clinicians should investigate high calcitonin levels associated with a pheochromocytoma as it may not always be ascribed to the thyroid."
33786258,"Abdominal anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) is an emerging diagnosis, with estimated incidence of 13% -30% of the adult population. It is a syndrome characterized by chronic abdominal pain caused by entrapment of cutaneous branches of thoracoabdominal nerves at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle. If conservative treatment with pain medication, botulinum toxin, or lidocaine injections is inadequate, surgical management is indicated. (1) The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ACNES."
30910995,"BACKGROUND Mirizzi syndrome is an uncommon but clinically important complication of gallbladder disease that occurs when there is extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct from gallstones within the cystic duct or from within the gallbladder itself. Obstructive jaundice and cholangitis may ensue. In severe cases, bile duct erosion or gallbladder rupture occur. CASE REPORT A demented 80-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with fever and right upper-quadrant abdominal guarding and tenderness. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a markedly dilated and thickened gallbladder with hyperdensity in the region of the gallbladder neck. The mass effect of these gallstones caused central intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation from extrinsic compression of the extrahepatic biliary duct, consistent with Mirizzi syndrome. Additionally, there were 2 areas of focal rupture of the gallbladder wall. General Surgery recommended non-operative management and temporizing the patient with a cholecystostomy tube. She remained in the hospital on IV antibiotics and discharged to follow-up as an outpatient with General Surgery. CONCLUSIONS Significant morbidity and mortality can be associated with the disease states of Mirizzi syndrome, and it is imperative for the ED physician to promptly recognize and treat such clinical entities. In general, treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, using the history and physical examination to guide appropriate consultation with General Surgery, Gastroenterology, or Interventional Radiology. The prognosis of Mirizzi syndrome is related to the degree of concomitant complications. Aggressive treatment is appropriate for most patients, with surgical intervention being individualized based on the stage and severity of the disease."
30900521,"Background: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a frequently carried out bariatric procedure, proven to be effective in the management of obesity and its accompanying health issues. Following its popularity, admission to the emergency department for abdominal pain is often seen with known early and late onset causes. We present a case of a young woman with vague abdominal pain years after her gastric bypass, who eventually underwent a resection of a 'candy cane' like biliopancreatic blind loop.Methods: A healthy 23-year-old woman has been suffering of vague abdominal complaints after a gastric bypass procedure 4 years earlier. Postprandial pain, diarrhoea and abdominal distension were present at a daily to weekly basis. Several investigations and management options were administered by surgeons, gastroenterologists as well as endocrinologists. On a performed explorative laparoscopy, a large blind loop at the entero-enteric anastomosis was seen and resected.Results: At current follow-up of 15 months the resection of the candy cane like blind end of the biliopancreatic loop resulted in a complete withdrawal of our patient's symptoms. A tentative diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth in the blind loop was made.Conclusions: Abdominal pain after gastric bypass is a frequent cause of admission to the emergency department. Besides the more serious complications, internal hernia is often withheld as possible diagnosis in the differential diagnosis of late onset, postprandial epigastric pain. This case report highlights another possibility. At initial surgery, a candy cane shaped blind loop should be avoided both at the gastro-jejunal as well as the entero-enteric anastomosis."

35093706,"Introduction and importance: Gossypiboma is defined as developing an exudative inflammatory process around retained foreign bodies (RFBs). This problem may be asymptomatic or present with severe systemic or regional symptoms. Traditionally, every RFB must be removed with a surgical procedure. In the era of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic removal is a good choice for these problems. (1) However, in some cases, the surgeon may be reluctant to perform a laparoscopic procedure due to the risk of injury to the surrounding organs."

35949234,"An 84-year-old thin, i.e., body mass index of 17.8, woman with gastric cancer underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy and lymph node dissection followed by Roux-en-Y reconstruction. During the operation, Nathanson liver retractor (NLR) was used to press the left lobe of the liver. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the 9th postoperative day. The patient, however, developed abdominal pain just on the day of discharge. Sudden onset of the abdominal pain and massive free air on computed tomography made us do diagnostic laparoscopy. Detailed laparoscopic observation showed slight liver swelling at the pressure site of the NLR, superficial band-shaped color change on the left lobe of the liver, and no anastomotic leakage, suggesting the massive free air caused by prolonged retention of postoperative intra-abdominal air. Two days later, persistent fever, inflammatory findings, and presumed liver abscess showing no healing tendency made us do ultrasound-guided aspiration to the liver focus. Bacterial culture test showed the bacterium Escherichia coli, being sensitive to meropenem. Despite the failure of abscess drainage, antibiotic therapy using meropenem gradually alleviated her symptoms and the patient was discharged from the hospital in 15 days after the abscess aspiration. Surgeons should note possible prolonged postoperative intra-abdominal free air and liver abscess without anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic gastrectomy especially in thin patients to avoid inappropriate postoperative management."
36128866,"Heterotopic mesenteric ossification (HMO) is abnormal bone formation in tissues which usually do not undergo ossification. There are approximately 75 cases reported worldwide. We present two cases of HMO. The first case is that of a 39-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain and a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an apple core lesion resulting in small bowel obstruction. The second case is that of a 36-year-old woman who presented 2 months after undergoing robotic gastric sleeve resection complaining of weakness and emesis. An esophagogram revealed kinking at the distal esophagus. Surgical resection was performed in both, yielding the diagnosis of HMO. There are various theories as to the pathophysiology of HMO, but no clearly defined mechanism has been established. Management should be conservative whenever possible to prevent further ossification with subsequent surgical intervention."

37798042,"Recurrent acute pancreatitis poses a significant challenge in clinical management. In this case, a young, obese woman with metabolic syndrome presented with her third episode of acute pancreatitis within a span of 4 months. Due to unavailability, plasmapheresis could not be performed, and the patient was managed solely with pharmacological therapy. Initial evaluation revealed abdominal pain, tenderness and elevated laboratory markers. CT scan findings indicated pancreatic and peripancreatic oedema. Further investigations highlighted the presence of hypertriglyceridaemia and hypocalcaemia. As the patient was using oral contraceptive pills (OCP), it was crucial to consider their potential role in causing hypertriglyceridaemia. Consequently, the patient was advised to discontinue OCP use. Despite the lack of plasmapheresis, intensive medical management, including medication and lifestyle modifications, showed positive results. This case underscores the importance of recognising the association between OCP, hypertriglyceridaemia and recurrent pancreatitis in patients with metabolic syndrome."

Ileocecal / ileocolic intusception caused by appendiceal mucocele is an extremely rare condition with few case reports in literatures. The treatment is surgery with the extent determined by intra-operative findings. Ultrasound and CECT scan can suggest the diagnosis, but definitive diagnosis is by histopathology. The aim of this presentation is to discuss appendiceal mucocele in terms of clinical features, diagnostic imaging and treatment. This case report can create awareness to primary care physicians, radiologists, surgeons and pathologists aiding in accurate diagnosis and early surgical intervention to prevent rupture."
30936329,"Haemangiomas are the most common benign tumours of the liver. Their origin lies in the proliferation of the vascular endothelium. Their growth mechanism is by dilation. They are considered giant when they exceed 5 cm at their greatest diameter. Very uncommon presentations surpass 15 cm; these are known as enormous haemangiomas. We present a case of a 54-year-old woman with an enormous haemangioma of 30 cm in diameter. A mass was present in her right upper quadrant along with dull abdominal pain for several years. It is unknown for how long the tumour had been developing. She underwent surgical management due to evident mass effect. Clinicians should be aware of the importance of early diagnosis in these types of tumours. Its erratic growth pattern, mass effect-related complications and the capacity of producing haematological abnormalities makes it an entity to be considered."

33135813,"Graft loss characterized by sudden deterioration after initial favorable recovery of the allograft function within the first week after liver transplantation was reported as ""seventh-day syndrome."" The outcome of seventh-day syndrome is extremely poor, and its etiology and management are not still established. We herein reported a seventh-day syndrome case who was successfully managed by immediate desensitization after liver retransplantation and reviewed by English literature. A 19-year-old woman who had underwent the first liver transplantation when she was 2-year-old. She developed graft failure due to chronic rejection and was on the waiting list for retransplantation. An evaluation of panel-reactive antibody showed high positivity, but there were no preformed donor-specific antibodies. Plasma exchange was performed one-time just before retransplantation and the mean fluorescence intensity significantly decreased. The second liver was successfully transplanted, and post-operative course was uneventful. However, on post-operative day 5, her body temperature elevated and thereafter, her liver enzymes dramatically elevated. We immediately started a desensitization consisted of plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anti-CD20 antibody. The peak level of AST and ALT was 5799 IU / L and 3960 IU / L, respectively. The pathological findings of liver biopsy revealed some central venous endotheliitis and massive centrilobular hemorrhagic hepatocellular necrosis. These findings were not typical for antibody-mediated rejection, but the desensitization was effective and liver graft was successfully rescued. The only way to prevent early graft loss due to seventh-day syndrome is thought to be an immediate decision to start intensive desensitization."

Abdominal ultrasound showed a mildly heterogenous and echogenic liver, without focal lesions, suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The only significant change from previous consultation four months prior was introduction of a ketogenic diet consisting of eggs, cheese, butter, oil, nuts, leafy green vegetables and milk (almond and coconut). The patient reported a reduction in hunger on this diet. Immediate discontinuation of the diet resulted in modest reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and liver enzymes two weeks later. Resolution of liver enzymes was seen within eight months and LDL-C levels normalized one year later. This case report discusses the rationale, benefits and risks of a ketogenic diet and encourages increased vigilance and monitoring of patients on such a diet."

31780602,"A 23-year-old woman was referred to the allergy and immunology clinic for recurrent abdominal, cutaneous and joint swelling and pain with a history of mucosal infections since childhood. Her history and clinical findings were suggestive of two rare and complex disorders, hereditary angioedema (HAE) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Her recurrent episodes of abdominal and joint pain were initially misattributed to more common diagnoses such as esophagitis, depression and chronic pain syndrome. However, the coexistence of HAE and EDS likely contributed to a delay in diagnoses as the combination of these two rare but overlapping disorders is less understood by physicians. She had persistently low levels of C4 and C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) with low to low-normal C1-esterase function, normal C1Q and no C1Q antibodies. In the setting of recurrent abdominal pain with cutaneous swelling, this supported the diagnosis of HAE type I. The increase in joint extensibility with recurrent shoulder subluxations since childhood was a manifestation of EDS. Although no known genetic mutations were identified for EDS, her diagnosis was confirmed by a geneticist based on her clinical phenotype. Before the diagnosis of HAE and EDS, our patient had at least 100 visits / year to the emergency department / hospitalisations for these recurrent symptoms. After starting on C1-INH replacement therapy, the frequency has decreased 10-fold. She also noted a 70% improvement in her quality of life. Familiarity with these rare disorders will assist healthcare providers in recognising HAE and EDS and include them as part of their differential diagnoses. Early diagnosis is important for a patient's well-being as both these chronic disorders have been associated with poor quality of life. Additionally, proper diagnoses will reduce healthcare costs by preventing unnecessary procedures due to misdiagnoses. Proper treatment will help to decrease hospitalisations and avoidance of life-threatening consequences (such as asphyxiation from fatal laryngeal attacks of HAE and rupture of aneurysms in EDS)."

It is a diagnostic challenge in the emergency department since the signs and symptoms are non-specific. It often occurs in elderly, emaciated and chronically ill women. The clinical picture include intestinal obstruction with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. The treatment is only surgical. Delayed diagnosis of this condition usually leads to a high mortality rate. We report the case of an 83-year-old woman with a strangulated obturator hernia. The hernia was discovered early by computed tomography and was treated by emergency laparotomy. We emphasize on the rule of CT scan to establishing a prompt preoperative diagnosis of an obturator hernia, appropriate planning of surgical intervention and thus optimizing the outcome."
34636790,"A 22-year-old woman with medically refractory ulcerative pancolitis underwent laparoscopic total proctocolectomy with IPAA and diverting ileostomy. She was discharged on postoperative day 4 feeling well. Because of the lack of risk factors for venous thromboembolism (including no family history or use of oral contraceptives), she was not discharged with prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin, but she received low-molecular-weight heparin while in the hospital. The following day, she developed abdominal pain, nausea / vomiting, and decreased ostomy output. An abdominopelvic CT scan demonstrated a small amount of intraperitoneal free air felt to be postoperative in nature, small-bowel dilation consistent with ileus, and extensive portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. She was started on low-molecular-weight heparin that resulted in rapid improvement. A subsequent repeat CT scan a few days later showed decreased clot burden."

36277738,"We report the case of a 61-year-old woman with painful chronic pancreatitis related to proximal pancreatic duct pancreatolithiasis who underwent successful fragmentation with pancreatic extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Two weeks later, she developed abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and was found to have a new 4.6 × 2.3 cm hepatic abscess. She was treated with antibiotics but did not require additional intervention. Reported etiologies of post-ESWL abdominal pain include local irritation and bruising at the interface and pancreatitis, which has been reported in 4.2% of cases. We suggest that hepatic abscess ought to be considered in the differential diagnosis of post-ESWL abdominal pain."
31198812,"The HELLP syndrome is an important variant of pre-eclampsia which is known by triad of hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzymes (EL) and low platelet count (LP). Intraparenchymal liver hematoma is a rare and important complication of HELLP syndrome which is a life threatening condition. The incidence of intraparenchymal hematoma of the liver has been reported to vary from 1 in each 40,000 to 250,000 deliveries worldwide. Herein we report a case of intraparenchymal liver hematoma following HELLP syndrome. An 18 year- old woman with moderate to severe preeclampsia after delivery, presented with Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and tachycardia and significant drop in hemoglobin level. Ultrasonography revealed intraparenchymal liver hematoma. This finding was also confirmed by computerized tomography (CT) -scan. Conservative treatment was applied and the patient improved without need of any surgical intervention.

36407142,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection typically presents with pharyngeal symptoms and subclinical transaminitis. We present a case of a 27-year-old woman with no known past medical history who presented with painless jaundice and dark-colored urine for three days. Her review of systems was negative for fever, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, or rash. Her last sexual contact was six months ago with a male partner, and she only drank alcohol socially. Family and surgical history were non-significant. Physical examination revealed 3 + bilateral conjunctival icterus without abdominal tenderness or organomegaly. She had elevated transaminases: alanine transaminase (ALT) of 1287U / L and aspartate aminotransferase of (AST) 1057U / L but her alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was only slightly above normal at 109U / L (normal range 35-104U / L), with a direct hyperbilirubinemia - total bilirubin 9.5mg / dl, direct bilirubin 6.8mg / dl; the abdominal ultrasound revealed non-dilated bile ducts. Hepatitis A, B, and C serology was negative, but her EBV serology showed an infection. She had incidental thalassemia minor without splenomegaly or asterixis. She was managed conservatively, and her liver enzymes trended down with supportive management. Although EBV is an uncommon cause of painless jaundice, this diagnosis should be considered, especially when other more common causes of jaundice have been ruled out. A high index of suspicion should be maintained to detect EBV hepatitis as it can easily be diagnosed through serological testing."
36176184,"BACKGROUND Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare tumor that can occur in different organs and anatomical locations. Colonic sarcomatoid carcinoma, also known as carcinosarcoma, is an extremely rare tumor, with only 32 cases reported world-wide. The pathogenesis and guidelines for treatment are poorly understood due to the rarity and invasiveness of the disease. CASE REPORT A 77-year-old woman presented with worsening lower abdominal pain and associated fever after having initially been diagnosed with stump appendicitis and associated phlegmon 3 weeks prior, which was treated with antibiotics. Repeat imaging revealed an extraluminal versus perforated colonic mass with associated phlegmon. The patient's condition continued to worsen, with development of obstructive-like symptoms, resulting in operative intervention involving a R2 right hemicolectomy, stapled ileo-colostomy, and partial omentectomy. The patient had an uneventful remainder of her hospitalization other than continued lower abdominal pain. After initial discharge, the patient presented to an outside hospital due to continued deterioration of health, with findings of an additional mass, likely secondary to the previous lymphadenopathy. Ultimately, goals of care were discussed, and the decision was made to provide palliative care, and the patient died due to her illness 32 days after the initial procedure. CONCLUSIONS Carcinosarcoma is an extremely rare tumor with scant research guiding treatment guidelines. Current guidelines gathered from previous case reports suggest treating colorectal carcinosarcoma as adenocarcinoma. Additional research and studies are needed to establish appropriate therapeutic guidelines for carcinosarcoma."

A combination of clinical suspicion, inflammatory blood markers and imaging modalities such as ultrasound and CT are used for its definitive diagnosis. Early detection and intervention are paramount to reduce morbidity and mortality. Laparoscopic appendicectomy is the current gold standard in the management of appendicitis, especially if complicated according to EAES guidelines. There are few documented cases in the literature of acute appendicitis secondary to foreign body ingestion. On account of this, there are currently no guidelines for its management. Our literature review highlights the importance of surgical management of foreign body acute appendicitis."

Liver involvement is a frequent feature, usually presenting with hepatomegaly and mild liver enzymes abnormalities, which usually normalize after treatment with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory drugs given for AOSD. Although uncommon, the onset of severe acute hepatitis and even of life-threatening liver failure is possible and requires a prompt diagnosis and an aggressive therapy and, in some cases, an emergency liver transplantation. The differential diagnosis of the cause of the liver injury can be very challenging in these patients."
31703187,"Endometriosis is a benign, estrogen-dependent chronic disorder. Pregnancy is considered to have a positive effect on endometriosis due to blockage of ovulation; however, evidence is emerging on the role of endometriosis not only in infertility but also in poor pregnancy outcomes. We present the case of a pregnant woman admitted for sudden and severe abdominal pain at 34 weeks gestation. Her previous medical history included endometriosis suspected by clinical symptoms and ultrasound. During cesarean section, performed by sustained fetal bradycardia, a large volume hemoperitoneum and multiple hemorrhagic foci in the posterior uterine wall were detected. Although rare, spontaneous hemoperitoneum may occur in pregnancy, especially in women with endometriosis. Thus, a prompt suspicion and expedite intervention are needed to improve maternal and fetal outcomes."
33906888,"Scombroid fish poisoning (SFP), the most common fish-related illness worldwide, is a histamine response caused by the heat stable toxin histamine. A healthy 48-year-old woman and co-author of this paper developed palpitations, tachycardia and hypotension 10 min after a tuna steak dinner. She subsequently developed numbness of her face, flushing, conjunctival erythema, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache and chest pain. Her ECG revealed tachycardia with ST depression. Her hypotension did not respond to fluid resuscitation, and she required phenylephrine. Based on exposure history, clinical syndrome, exclusion of other diseases and consultation with poison control, a diagnosis of scombroid poisoning was established. The state health department was notified. The patient was weaned off vasopressors, dosed famotidine and discharged 43 hours after fish ingestion with no symptoms and normal ECG. SFP is an often misdiagnosed and underreported illness with the potential to cause life-threatening hypotension."
33055481,"Cecal volvulus is an uncommon cause of colonic obstruction. First-line treatment for cecal volvulus is surgery, as nonoperative management is rarely achievable. We herein report an extremely rare case of a patient with spontaneously resolved cecal volvulus; no recurrence occurred without elective surgery. A 47-year-old woman presented with acute lower abdominal pain. She was misdiagnosed with small bowel obstruction and treated conservatively. A few hours later, she was correctly diagnosed with cecal volvulus. Subsequently, her symptoms and computed tomography findings of cecal volvulus completely disappeared. She refused elective surgery, but no recurrence occurred during five months of follow-up."
31032566,"Background: When a woman with an endometrioma presents with acute abdominal pain, it is unclear whether ovarian torsion should be suspected. (1) The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of ovarian torsion in women with endometriomas and to identify the clinical and sonographic features that may help to distinguish ovarian torsion from endometrioma. (2) Methods: This was a retrospective study of women with endometriomas who underwent surgery at our institution between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015."
34193446,"We present an 87-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of severe abdominal pain at her ileostomy parastomal hernia site. Prior to presentation, her general practitioner had started her on a reducing steroid dose for suspected Crohn's disease exacerbation. On examination, she had a distended abdomen with localised guarding and tenderness over her hernia site. A CT scan demonstrated an incarcerated perforated gallbladder within her parastomal hernia. Successful surgical management was performed involving an enterotomy, refashioning her ileostomy and an open cholecystectomy. The patient recovered well with a short postoperative stay. This report is intended as a guide for clinicians in the differential diagnoses for acute abdominal pain and an unusual presentation of a gallbladder perforation."
36595862,"Rationale: Heterotopic pregnancy (HP) is defined as the simultaneous presence of intrauterine pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy (EP). HP after bilateral salpingectomy is extremely rare and may lead to serious complications if it is misdiagnosed and untreated timely. Here, we presented the first reported case of uterine serosal HP in a woman after assisted reproductive technology with bilateral salpingectomy because of bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancy. (1,2) We also discussed the diagnosis and treatment of HP."
32309003,"Ingestion of a foreign body is commonly encountered in clinical practice, but most cause no complications, passing spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract. However, they can cause obstructive signs and symptoms, and surgical intervention for extraction of the foreign body may be required after identifying its location. We present here the case of a 49-year-old woman who presented to our emergency room with abdominal pain localizing to the right lower quadrant. Evaluation was most consistent with acute appendicitis, and she underwent uncomplicated appendectomy. A keratin nail with Actinomyces was identified in her appendix. Foreign bodies in the appendix can cause simple appendicitis, perforation, periappendiceal abscess, and peritonitis. Regardless of etiology, an appendectomy often ends up the primary treatment, but unusual and rare causes are worth noting if only for the clinician to be aware of when evaluating the next patient with abdominal pain and considering treatment options or future prevention. Our case is an example of a rare scenario in which an Actinomyces-contaminated human nail lodged in the appendix of a woman eventually resulting in acute appendicitis."
34429963,"Introduction: Splenic artery aneurysms are a rare arterial disease. They are considered as the most common visceral artery aneurysms and found mostly in multiparous women and patients with portal hypertension. (1) The incidence of splenic artery aneurysms is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 to 15,000. (2) Splenic artery aneurysms are usually asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally during abdominal imaging. (3) The most common presentation is abdominal pain, and the most common complication is rupture. (4) The diagnosis is made by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (5) The treatment of choice is surgical resection. (6) The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of splenic artery aneurysms. (7) Methods: A retrospective review of patients with splenic artery aneurysms treated at our institution from January 2000 to December 2015 was performed."
35127075,"Introduction: and importance: Meckel's Diverticulum (MD) is the most usual congenital anatomic abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. It is present in almost 2% of the population and it rarely becomes symptomatic in adults. Herein, we report a rare case of an elderly woman with MD, its diagnostic algorithm and treatment, pointing out the significance of this pathology in the differential diagnosis of right lower quadrant pain. (1,2). (3). (4)."
35999773,"BACKGROUND Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare obstetric emergency that most commonly occurs in the third trimester and has high mortality rates for the mother and fetus. AFLP is a diagnosis of exclusion supported by identifying 6 or more of the 15 Swansea criteria. This report is of a 24-year-old woman presenting in the third trimester of pregnancy with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and diagnosed with AFLP. CASE REPORT A 24-year-old woman presented at 36 weeks of gestation with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Investigations showed leukocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, increased liver enzymes, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and coagulopathy. Ten of the 15 Swansea criteria were fulfilled. An emergency cesarean section resulted in the delivery of a healthy infant, followed by a normalization of the mother's liver function. Because long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency in the infant can be associated with maternal AFLP, genotyping of the infant was planned. CONCLUSIONS This report has shown the importance of clinical awareness, rapid diagnosis, and management of AFLP. Screening for fetal LCHAD deficiency could help decrease mortality."
30737322,"A 30-year-old woman presented with severe abdominal pain and abdominal distension. CT demonstrated two intra-abdominal masses, one involving the left lateral segment of the liver and the other adjacent to the duodenum. Initial biopsies were consistent with focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver and non-specific lymphocytic infiltrate in the paraduodenal mass. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the paraduodenal mass. Final pathology was consistent with an inflammatory pseudotumour and the patient's symptoms subsequently resolved."
35103434,"Hydatid cysts are caused by Echinococcus granulosus. The usual organs in which the parasite lodges are the liver and lungs. One of the most peculiar locations for cyst formation is the ovary and most of these cases are secondary. It has been reported that some cases are formed iatrogenically. In our practice, we encountered three cases of ovarian hydatid cysts with a common symptom of abdominal pain. Imaging studies showed the presence of cystic lesions.Our first case was particularly interesting as the ultrasonographic characteristics were consistent with malignancy; however, surgical intervention showed that she had a hydatid cyst. Of note, this appeared to be a primary cyst because no other lesion was detected at the time. Our second case was diagnosed with infertility and under treatment prior to referral to our centre. Ultrasound (US) imaging showed the presence of a large cyst. The patient underwent laparoscopic cystectomy and the parasitic lesion was removed; however, she was subsequently diagnosed with urticaria and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). She made an uncomplicated recovery. Our third case was a pregnant woman with a previous diagnosis of a hydatid cyst. She underwent surgery for a suspected ruptured cyst, which was determined to be parasitic. Due to similarities in appearance, these cysts can be confused with other lesions. Careful management of these cysts in highly prevalent areas must be considered. Despite advanced technology, hydatid cysts present challenges for both surgeons and radiologists."
33130583,"A 32-year-old woman underwent a medical termination in the second trimester of a spontaneously conceived triploid pregnancy after developing early-onset preeclampsia with subsequent haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Placental histology was normal (non-molar) and unusually, she developed ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 4 weeks later. She was managed conservatively following multidisciplinary team input to exclude malignant pathology. The rarity of late-onset spontaneous OHSS could have resulted in inappropriate surgical management. In the absence of supportive treatment there is also a risk of the condition progressing to a critical stage. Follow-up ultrasonography after termination of pregnancy should be considered for women with evidence of ovarian hyperstimulation, particularly if other risk factors for OHSS are present. Delayed-onset OHSS should be considered in women presenting with bilateral cystic ovarian enlargement after triploid pregnancy."
36805852,"Background: Postpartum hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome is more difficult to treat than HELLP syndrome during pregnancy. We describe a case of postpartum HELLP syndrome that responded to plasma exchange (PE) therapy. (1) Case presentation: A 33-year-old woman with a history of preeclampsia at 28 weeks of gestation was admitted to our hospital with severe abdominal pain and jaundice. (2) She was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome and treated with PE."
35261465,"A 57-year-old woman presented with left-sided abdominal pain and was found to have a large retroperitoneal mass in the left upper quadrant. Surgical excision and histopathologic evaluation demonstrated an adrenocortical carcinoma arising from the colonic mesentery. Ectopic adrenocortical carcinomas are extremely rare tumors with an unknown incidence. Functioning tumors typically present with the Cushing syndrome and / or virilization, whereas nonfunctioning tumors result in abdominal pain from mass effect. They are highly aggressive tumors with an overall poor prognosis."
30590129,"Uterine inversions are a rare entity, and most occur in the postpartum period. nonpuerperal inversion accounts for only 16% of cases and are mostly associated with a submucous myoma. A 38-year-old woman with a submucous myoma presented with severe lower abdominal pain, acute retention of urine, and hypotension. Because the clinical examination was inconclusive due to severe pain and the ultrasound was dubious, diagnosis was made with magnetic resonance imaging. Successful laparoscopic hysterectomy was contemplated after correcting uterine inversion. This case highlights the diagnostic dilemmas and the key points during laparoscopic management of uterine inversion."
35279354,"Background: Urinomas are rare and generally result from trauma to any part of the urinary collecting system. Appropriate imaging is crucial in the timely diagnosis and management of urinomas and for ruling out other etiologies such as subcapsular renal hematomas and perinephric abscesses. (1) The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and management of urinomas in patients with blunt trauma. (2) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with blunt trauma who were admitted to our emergency department between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015."
33837030,"A healthy 32-year-old G3P3 woman with an unknown last menstrual period presented to the emergency department with intense abdominal pain and pain in the right chest that radiated down the right arm. Further workup showed that she had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy with significant haemoperitoneum. After successful laparoscopic evacuation of the ectopic pregnancy and haemoperitoneum, the patient subsequently developed a right ovarian vein thrombosis 4 weeks after the procedure. She was treated with anticoagulation, and further haematological studies did not show any significant findings. Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis is extremely rare and can be life- threatening if not accurately diagnosed and treated with anticoagulation or surgical management in a timely manner."
35496747,"Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, also known as Cast syndrome, Wilkie's syndrome, or duodenal ileus, is a rare condition involving compression of the duodenum between the aorta and the SMA, primarily attributed to loss of the intervening mesenteric fat pad. Clinical symptoms include postprandial epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, and weight loss. At-risk individuals include those with rapid weight loss, debilitating illness, malignancy, malabsorption syndromes, trauma, neurologic injury, eating disorders, and substance abuse. Here, we present a case of SMA syndrome in a 24-year-old woman presenting with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain who improved with conservative management."

34976488,"Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant genetic disease that causes tissue edema mediated by bradykinin. The angioedema attacks have several triggers including stress, trauma, infection, and increased estrogens levels. This explains the greater incidence and clinical severity in women, which are usually asymptomatic until puberty, when the attacks begin to occur. It may involve multiple locations on the body, leading to complications, such as surgical intervention prompt by severe acute abdominal pain, and laryngeal edema that can culminate in death from asphyxia. This is of particular concern as this angioedema does not respond to life-saving medications commonly used in its treatment, namely, high doses of second-generation antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. Hereditary angioedema attacks are treated with specific medication that includes icatibant, ecallantide, and C1 inhibitor, the latter being also used in short-term and long-term prophylaxis. There are other pharmacological strategies for long-term prophylaxis like lanadelumab, danazol, stanozolol, aminocaproic acid, and tranexamic acid. During pregnancy and lactation, the preferred treatment and prophylaxis is C1 inhibitor. We report a case of hereditary angioedema describing its chronological evolution over a period of a woman's life, and highlighting some of the specificities of this pathology that intersect with the specialty of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Our aim is to draw attention to these particularities, namely the triggering factors of crisis, the need for high suspicion of the diagnosis, and the treatment and prophylaxis options for pregnant and non-pregnant women that can make the difference between life and death. To achieve a favorable outcome, the multidisciplinary teamwork between the specialties of Immunoallergology and Obstetrics and Gynecology was crucial."
35859937,"Bladder leiomyoma is a rare benign mesothelial tumor that is more commonly reported in women. Most patients present with frequent urination or obstructive urinary symptoms. Here, we portray a 50-year-old woman who presented to the clinic with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Imaging showed a lobulated mass at the posterior aspect of the urinary bladder. The pathology of the surgery demonstrated a benign mesenchymal neoplasm composed of interlacing bundles of smooth muscle fibers with a whirling pattern, which eventually confirmed bladder leiomyoma. Although this tumor is benign, it can be misdiagnosed with other diseases such as a urothelial lesion or urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder. Accordingly, it can inevitably affect patient management. Therefore, it must be diagnosed quickly and accurately and appropriate treatment should be applied."
