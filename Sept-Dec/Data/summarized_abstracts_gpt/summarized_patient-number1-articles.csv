33178912,"Differently from lactational (milk production) and physiological (white, green, or yellow), which are usually bilateral and involving multiple ducts, pathologic nipple discharge (PND) is a spontaneous commonly single-duct and unilateral, clear, serous, or bloody secretion. Galactography is an invasive technique that may cause discomfort and pain; it can be performed only when the duct discharge is demonstrated at the time of the study, with incomplete/failed examination rate up to 15% and a difficult differentiation between malignant and benign lesions."

37733618,"Indications for problem-solving MRI include equivocal or uncertain imaging findings at mammography and/or US; suspicious nipple discharge or skin changes suspected to represent an abnormality when conventional imaging results are negative for cancer; lesions categorized as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4, which are not amenable to biopsy; and discordant radiologic-pathologic findings after biopsy."
33295815,"Although central duct excision is the current standard for evaluation of malignancy in patients with pathologic nipple discharge, studies suggest that, given the high negative predictive value of MRI, surveillance may be a reasonable alternative to surgery."

32072386,"This article mainly focuses on emphasizing the results of basic histo-anatomical differences of male and female breasts, classifying male breast lesions, covering the spectrum of male breast diseases, and assisting radiologists in recognizing the imaging findings, in interpreting them through a holistic approach, in making a differential diagnosis, and in being a part of proper patient management."

36900021,"We evaluated clinical (age of patient, size of lesion, pathologic nipple discharge, palpability, personal/family history of breast cancer or papillary lesion, location, multiplicity, and bilaterality) and imaging characteristics (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), sonographic, and mammographic findings) and compared malignant versus non-malignant lesions and papillary lesions with versus without PND. The malignant group showed higher BI-RADS, irregular shape, complex cystic and solid echo pattern, posterior enhancement on ultrasound (US), fatty breasts, visibility, and mass type on mammography (p < 0.001, 0.003, 0.009, <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, and 0.01, respectively)."

35855197,Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the capabilities of ductography (DG) to navigate stereotactic core-needle biopsy (sCNB) for localizing and differentiating intraductal benign and malignant proliferations of the breast in patients with pathological nipple discharge (PND).
33250296,
31352554,Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine the ability of MRI to identify and assess the extent of disease in patients with pathological nipple discharge (PND) with an occult malignancy not evident on standard pre-operative evaluation with mammography and ultrasound.

33074785,"History A 44-year-old woman who was a resident of Bihar, which is a state in eastern India, presented to the surgical outpatient department of our hospital with a history of gradually increasing swelling of the right breast associated with redness, pain, and itching over the past month. No history suggestive of a possible hypercoagulable state could be elicited (she was a nonsmoker, had undergone uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery 15 years earlier, was not taking oral contraceptives, and had no history to suggest past deep venous thrombosis)."
36409422,
35169408,"Given the increasing popularity of CEM in breast imaging practice and its utility in the evaluation of patients with nipple discharge, recognition of retained intraductal contrast as a source of artifact on CEM is important so that steps can be taken to prevent acquiring a limited and/or non-diagnostic CEM."

Direct and indirect comparisons were performed using an NMA approach to evaluate the combined odd ratios and to determine the surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) of the diagnostic value of different imaging methods for the detection of breast cancer in patients with PND."
