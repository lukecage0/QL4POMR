34865718,"Infections have a significant impact on increasing both the morbidity and mortality rate of patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Infection after CABG imposes a clinical and economic burden on patients and health care organizations; therefore, prevention should be on the agenda. This review will focus on the value of using prophylactic antibiotics in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Prophylactic antibiotics like cephalosporin and vancomycin are more commonly used antibiotics and are strongly associated with reduced infection risk in patients. The results showed that using antibiotics during the perioperative period and after CABG is an effective strategy for reducing post-infection problems without compromising the patients' clinical outcomes. Diabetic patients are prone to postoperative infection after CABG, however, prophylactic antibiotics should not be the only strategy used to reduce the risk of postoperative infection in diabetic patients. Perioperative glycaemic control is essential for diabetic patients undergoing CABG. Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis has a great impact on preventing infection after CABG but duration and selecting appropriate antibiotic is important. Standardizing the use of antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the rate of infection and unwanted bacterial resistance, which could subsequently reduce economic costs to patients and public health."

34953653,"Background: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) are at high risk for developing postoperative delirium (POD). A simple prediction rule may benefit patients from early identification of POD followed by adequate preventive strategies. The purpose of the current study was to develop and validate a POD prediction rule for patients undergoing CABG (POD-CABG), by considering all possible perioperative factors. (1) Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital."
35787766,"Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most important complications after cardiac surgery and is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Diabetes mellitus also is one of the main risk factors for renal dysfunction in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). In this study, we aimed to compare the early postoperative period results of type 2 diabetes patients taking oral antidiabetics (OAD) or insulin medications, with microalbuminuria and normal creatinine levels after CABG."
34332004,"Background: Although diabetes is a recognized risk factor for postoperative infections, the seminal Portland Diabetic Project studies in cardiac surgery demonstrated intravenous insulin infusions following open-cardiac surgery achieved near normal glycaemia and decreased deep sternal wound infection to similar rates to those without diabetes. (1) We hypothesized that the Portland Diabetes Project study would demonstrate that perioperative intravenous insulin infusions following open-cardiac surgery are associated with decreased deep sternal wound infection rates. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing open-cardiac surgery at a single institution from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012."
36899306,"Background: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a rapidly growing disorder worldwide, especially in the Middle East. A higher incidence of coronary artery diseases requiring coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery has been reported in patients with diabetes. We assessed the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in-hospital major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) and postoperative complications among patients who underwent on-pump isolated CABG. (1) Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery at the National Heart Institute, Egypt, between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015."
31462521,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation is the most common dysrhythmia to occur after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It develops in 10% to 40% of patients and can lead to complications such as hemodynamic instability, heart failure, and stroke. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity. Patients who experience postoperative atrial fibrillation often have longer hospital stays, are at higher risk for readmission, and have increased mortality. Protocols designed to reduce the incidence of the condition can decrease hospital costs, improve patient outcomes, and increase overall quality of care. This quality improvement project took place in a tertiary care center located in southeastern Michigan and focused on the development and implementation of an evidence-based postoperative atrial fibrillation prophylaxis protocol using amiodarone. The outcomes of this project suggest that amiodarone prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients with no previous history of atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery."

31311660,"There is insufficient data regarding the comparative efficacy of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) regarding myocardial infarction (MI). Our systematic review included randomized controlled trials that compared CABG versus PCI with stents in patients with multivessel or left main coronary artery disease (CAD). Included trials should have had reported event number of MI and a clinical follow-up of one or more years. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary end point was MI at the longest available follow-up in the intention-to-treat population. Fifteen trials with a total of 13,592 patients treated with either CABG (n = 6,596) or PCI (n = 6,996) were included. After a weighted follow-up of 4.5 years, patients treated with CABG had a significantly lower risk of MI than those treated with PCI (risk ratio [RR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.96, p = 0.024). The lower risk of MI with CABG as compared with PCI was more evident during a longer duration of follow-up (≥ 3 years, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91, p = 0.008; ≥ 5 years, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86, p = 0.003) and in the diabetic population (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.70, p < 0.001). The magnitude of risk reduction was similar across patients with multivessel (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99) and left main CAD (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.15). In conclusion, the present meta-analysis of studies involving patients with multivessel or left main CAD suggests a significant benefit of CABG over PCI concerning the risk of future MI."

32919619,"Up to 10% of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients require coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery during their hospitalization. Contemporary, real-world, data regarding CABG utilization and safety in NSTEMI patients are lacking. Our objectives were to investigate the contemporary trends in utilization and outcomes of CABG in patients admitted for NSTEMI. Using the 2003 to 2015 National Inpatient Sample data, we identified hospitalizations for NSTEMI, during which a CABG was performed. Patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, incidence of surgical complications, length of stay, and mortality were analyzed. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of in-hospital complications and mortality. An estimated total of 440,371 CABG surgeries, during a hospitalization for NSTEMI, were analyzed. The utilization of CABG was steady over the years. The data show increasing prevalence of individual co-morbidities as well as cases with Deyo Co-morbidity Index ≥ 2 (p < 0.001). High, 26.4%, complication rate was driven mainly by cardiac and pulmonary complications. The mortality rate declined from 3.6% in 2003 to an average of 2.4% during 2010 to 2015. Older age, female gender, heart failure, and delayed CABG timing were independent predictors of adverse outcomes. In conclusion, utilization of in-hospital CABG as the primary revascularization strategy in patients with NSTEMI remained steady over the years. These data reveal the raising prevalence of co-morbidities during the study. High complication rate was recorded; however, the mortality declined over the years to about 2.4%. Delaying CABG was associated with small but statistically significant worsening in outcomes."

The institutional database was linked to the Connecticut Department of Public Health Death Index to capture statewide long-term mortality and causes of death. Regression models were fitted to evaluate the association between IVDU status and perioperative adverse events, mid-term survival, and causes of death. IVDU patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities. Diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft were less frequently present in IVDU patients compared to non-IVDU patients (P < 0.05 for all). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality prediction score for IE was lower in IVDU patients (22.9 vs 33.6, P < 0.001). IVDU was associated with a significantly increased risk of perioperative adverse events (odds ratio 2.88, 95% confidence interval 1.02-8.12) and increased risk of mid-term mortality (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.78, P = 0.04). The leading cause of death in IVDU patients was related to recidivism whereas that of non-IVDU patients was related to chronic conditions. IVDU patients who underwent cardiac surgery for IE experienced higher risks of perioperative adverse events and inferior mid-term survival compared to non-IVDU, despite being younger and having less comorbidities. Deaths in IVDU cohort were predominantly due to recidivism. Efforts to improve long-term outcome of patients presenting with IVDU IE should include drug addiction intervention and other strategies to reduce recidivism."
31895030,Background: Acute kidney injury is a common complication of cardiac surgery that increases morbidity and mortality. The present study aims to analyze the association of preoperative urinary pH with acute kidney injury after isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). (1) Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted on patients undergoing isolated CABG. (1) Results: The mean age of the patients was 62.72 ± 9.35 years. (2) Conclusion: Preoperative urinary pH is a simple and inexpensive test that can be used to predict acute kidney injury after CABG.
33622099,"Objectives. Mediastinal chest tubes are considered to be a significant factor causing postoperative pain after cardiac surgery. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether the duration of mediastinal drainage is associated with postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Design. A total of 468 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the Tampere University Hospital between December 2015 and August 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The first 252 patients were treated according to short and the following 216 patients according to extended drainage protocol, in which the mediastinal chest tubes were habitually removed on the first and second postoperative day, respectively. The oxycodone hydrochloride consumption, as well as daily mean pain scores assessed by numeric / visual rating scales, were compared between the groups. Results. The mean daily pain scores and cumulative opioid consumption were similar in both groups. Patients with reduced ejection fraction, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease reported lower initial pain scores. The median cumulative oxycodone hydrochloride consumption did not differ according to the drainage protocol but was higher in males, smokers, and after aortic surgery. In contrast, patients with advanced age, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease had lower consumption. In multivariable analysis, male sex and aortic surgery were associated with higher and advanced age with lower opioid use. Conclusions. The length of mediastinal chest tube drainage is not associated with the amount of postoperative pain or need for opioids after cardiac surgery. Male sex and aortic surgery were associated with higher and advanced age with lower overall opioid consumption."
31451466,"Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare complication of chronic alcoholism; however, MBD in a non-alcoholic diabetic patient has rarely been reported. The aetiology or pathophysiology of MBD is still unknown. A 50-year-old man with a history of untreated diabetes mellitus underwent on-pump beating coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) surgery for three-vessel and left main coronary disease. 3 days after the surgery, he developed a fever over 40 ° C and entered a coma state. MRI revealed multiple lesions, including in the corpus callosum, globus pallidus, brain stem and upper cervical spinal cord, which suggested MBD. The patient did not respond to thiamine therapy, but partly responded to steroid therapy. He ultimately died of respiratory failure. The autopsy revealed MBD and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. It is rare, but systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by on-pump beating CABG could develop these complication."
