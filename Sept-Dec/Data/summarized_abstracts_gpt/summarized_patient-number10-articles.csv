34209445,"Blount's disease is an idiopathic developmental abnormality affecting the medial proximal tibia physis resulting in a multi-planar deformity with pronounced tibia varus. A single cause is unknown, and it is currently thought to result from a multifactorial combination of hereditary, mechanical, and developmental factors. Relationships with vitamin D deficiency, early walking, and obesity have been documented. Regardless of the etiology, the clinical and radiographic findings are consistent within the two main groups. Early-onset Blount's disease is often bilateral and affects children in the first few years of life. Late-onset Blount's disease is often unilateral and can be sub-categorized as juvenile tibia vara (ages 4-10), and adolescent tibia vara (ages 11 and older). Early-onset Blount's disease progresses to more severe deformities, including depression of the medial tibial plateau. Additional deformities in both groups include proximal tibial procurvatum, internal tibial torsion, and limb length discrepancy. Compensatory deformities in the distal femur and distal tibia may occur. When non-operative treatment fails the deformities progress through skeletal maturity and can result in pain, gait abnormalities, premature medial compartment knee arthritis, and limb length discrepancy. Surgical options depend on the patient's age, weight, extent of physeal involvement, severity, and number of deformities. They include growth modulation procedures such as guided growth for gradual correction with hemi-epiphysiodesis and physeal closure to prevent recurrence and equalize limb lengths, physeal bar resection, physeal distraction, osteotomies with acute correction and stabilization, gradual correction with multi-planar dynamic external fixation, and various combinations of all modalities. The goals of surgery are to restore normal joint and limb alignment, equalize limb lengths at skeletal maturity, and prevent recurrence. The purpose of this literature review is to delineate basic concepts and reconstructive surgical treatment strategies for patients with Blount's disease."
31466661,"Posttraumatic arthritis (PTA) is a form of joint degeneration that occurs after physical trauma to a synovial joint. Development of PTA is multifactorial and results from mechanical damage at the time of trauma, a cell-mediated inflammatory response, and abnormal articulation due to persistent malalignment or joint instability. Although some risk factors may be unavoidable, preventing the development of PTA of the knee after intra-articular fracture (IAF) requires restoring anatomic articulation and alignment. Reconstruction with total knee arthroplasty is the treatment of choice for PTA and may be a useful primary treatment for IAF in some."

31165193,"We report a case of a 16-year-old boy who presented a soft-tissue mass in the anterior compartment of the right thigh discovered by positron emission tomography / computed tomography within the work-up of unexplained prolonged inflammatory syndrome. The mass has no calcification. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging of the femoral triangle was carried out. Axial short tau inversion recovery images showed a 3.5-cm ill-defined mass in the femoral triangle with focal areas of hypointensity, which suggests that there might be fibrosis or hemosiderin within the tumor. Axial T1-weighted images showed a slight hyperintense mass involving the iliopsoas muscle. Contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted imaging showed a heterogeneous solid enhancement. Adjacent thick fascia enhancement of the vastus intermedius and the vastus lateralis muscles extending from the mass as a tail-like margin suggested the infiltrative spread of the tumor along the fascial plane. The mass and the lymphadenopathy were excised. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were staining for muscle actin and desmin. Many plasma cells were IgG4 + (175per high-power field) with a ratio IgG4 + / IgG + of 50%. The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) was made. Although a diffuse array of musculoskeletal symptoms has been observed in IgG4-related disease, reports of biopsy-proven musculoskeletal involvement of the limb are rare. We showed the radiological features of IgG4-RD presenting as a soft-tissue mass of the thigh. Musculoskeletal involvement, clinical significance, and treatment of IgG4-RD are also discussed."

32590790,"Rationale: Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma (PSP) is a rare benign tumor of the lung, mostly presented in Asian middle-aged women. Initially, it was considered as a vascular origin tumor, but then research evidence showed that it was derived from natural epithelial tissue. On imaging, this tumor may be found as a solitary well-circumscribed lung parenchymal lesion, and is often located in juxtapleural or juxtafissural positions. On histopathology, it consists of cuboidal surface cells and stromal round cells, both of which are positive for thyroid transcription factor-1. Here we report a case of a young PSP male patient and review the relevant literature in order to improve our understanding of this disease."

32950242,"Soft tissue sarcomas in children are rare tumor, representing around 6 to 7% of children cancer. They spread mostly sporadically (90%) and therefore are rarely associated to an underlying constitutional genetic disease (10%). About half of those sarcomas are rhabdomyosarcomas and the others are a very heterogenous histologic group with various bio-pathologies and prognosis. Clinical presentation is mainly a soft tissue lump often difficult to distinguish from more frequent benign causes (malformative, infectious, benign, or pseudotumor). Inappropriate initial diagnosis work-up has a strong impact on soft tissue sarcomas' prognosis. Adapted complementary investigations (first ultrasound and MRI) are important to compile arguments for a malign origin and to indicate a biopsy. However, predictive value of imaging exams still remains imperfect, and histological analysis by percutaneous image-guided biopsy and sometimes by surgical biopsy is often necessary. Authors realize an update on optimal diagnostic pathway including molecular tests in presence of a soft tissue mass in a child."
35667602,"Patients with Crohn's disease often have low bone mineral density and an increased risk of osteoporosis. Although decreased bone formation can be seen at diagnosis, the underlying pathophysiology of suboptimal bone accrual remains poorly understood. We sought to evaluate a novel mechanism affecting osteogenesis in patients with Crohn's disease. In this case series, we evaluated bone marrow composition at the distal femur and proximal tibia of the left knee measured via magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and relaxometry in five adolescents with the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. The subjects were enrolled prospectively between 2011 and 2013 at Boston Children's Hospital. Additional clinical information, including DXA scans to evaluate bone mineral density and body composition, and Crohn's disease history, such as glucocorticoid use and disease duration, were assessed. Healthy adolescents have persistent hematopoietic marrow with only 40 to 50% fat in the long bone metaphyses. The current participants with Crohn's disease had increased marrow adiposity, with a mean fat fraction of 67.8%. There appeared to be a trend towards higher fat fraction with shorter disease duration, while participants with the longest disease duration had the lowest fat fraction. Participants also had decreased bone density, increased fat mass, and lower lean mass, as assessed by DXA and compared to pediatric reference data. Our MRI results demonstrate increased marrow adiposity in children with Crohn's disease, especially early in the course of the disease. DXA may better demonstrate longer-term effects on bone. Additional studies are needed to evaluate bone marrow composition in these patients and to elucidate further the inverse relationship between marrow adipocytes and osteogenesis, as well as the relationship between bone marrow adiposity and body composition."

30679114,"Fat-free mass as well as lean soft tissue mass is a surrogate for skeletal muscle mass and is often used for the normalization of several physiological variables or for the diagnosing of low muscle mass in older adults. However, both fat-free mass and lean tissue mass include nonskeletal muscle components such as the fat-free component of adipose tissue fat cells. A technique known as water-fat MRI provides a noninvasive and radiation-free assessment of the fat-free component of adipose tissue in humans. However, if this method is impractical or unavailable, some authors suggest that a constant value for the fat-free component of adipose tissue can be used as an indirect estimate. The purpose of this review is to examine the fat fraction percentage of white (subcutaneous) adipose tissue in adolescents and young / middle-aged / older adults measured by water-fat MRI and provide discussion on how the fat-free adipose tissue values from the water-fat separation method compare with the constant value used in previous studies. Calculated mean values for the percentage of fat fraction in subcutaneous adipose tissue were 86.9% in the overall sample, 86.4% in adolescents (3 studies), and 87.1% in young, middle-aged and older adults (7 studies). This is similar to the 85% value proposed in the classical studies but in the majority of studies the 85% estimate was outside of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the water-fat MRI estimate. There may be several factors to consider that may affect the fat fraction percentage (e.g. reliability of the MRI estimate, age, sex, obesity, etc.), however, at this time there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of each of these variables. If the measurement is reliable, then this might suggest that the 85% constant may need to be altered to better reflect the water-fat MRI estimate."
37835554,"Synovial sarcomas are rare and highly aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas, primarily affecting adolescents and young adults aged 15-40 years. These tumors typically arise in the deep soft tissues, often near the large joints of the extremities. While the radiological features of these tumors are not definitely indicative, the presence of calcification in a soft-tissue mass (occurring in 30% of cases), adjacent to a joint, strongly suggests the diagnosis. Cross-sectional imaging characteristics play a crucial role in diagnosing synovial sarcomas. They often reveal significant characteristics such as multilobulation and pronounced heterogeneity (forming the ""triple sign""), in addition to features like hemorrhage and fluid-fluid levels with septa (resulting in the ""bowl of grapes"" appearance). Nevertheless, the existence of non-aggressive features, such as gradual growth (with an average time to diagnosis of 2-4 years) and small size (initially measuring < 5 cm) with well-defined margins, can lead to an initial misclassification as a benign lesion. Larger size, older age, and higher tumor grade have been established as adverse predictive indicators for both local disease recurrence and the occurrence of metastasis. Recently, the prognostic importance of CT and MRI characteristics for synovial sarcomas was elucidated. These include factors like the absence of calcification, the presence of cystic components, hemorrhage, the bowl of grape sign, the triple sign, and intercompartmental extension. Wide surgical excision remains the established approach for definitive treatment. Gaining insight into and identifying the diverse range of presentations of synovial sarcomas, which correlate with the prognosis, might be helpful in achieving the optimal patient management."
31425335,"Distal femur physeal fractures are known to have a high incidence of complications. Our previous reported experience (pre-2007) showed a 40% complication risk, which prompted changes in our approach. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the complication rate and outcome after implementation of these changes. This is a retrospective study of children with distal femur physeal fractures treated at a level 1 pediatric trauma center between 2007 and 2016. Patient demographics, fracture patterns, treatment and outcomes including complications and its risk factors were recorded and analyzed. We compared current results with our previously reported multicenter cohort (n = 73). Patients were male in majority (57 / 70) with a mean age of 13 ± 4 years. Fractures were most commonly Salter-Harris Type 2 (49 / 70) and displaced (59 / 70) on presentation, although neither characteristic was associated with complications. Most patients (63 / 70) were treated surgically, and the overall complication incidence was 36% (25 / 70), including growth arrest in 20 patients. The pre-2007 cohort was statistically significantly younger (P < 0.001) and was more commonly treated nonoperatively (P < 0.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in complication incidence between studies (36% versus 40%, respectively, P = 0.751). Despite a lower threshold for surgery for distal femur physeal fractures in the past decade, the complication rate is still high and unchanged at 40%, and presenting patients are older. There were no new prognostic factors that showed statistically significant association with subsequent complications; however, patients with high-energy injury mechanisms and greater fracture displacements did have higher complication rates. These results demonstrate the inherent high complication risk for these injuries. Level of Evidence: III."
34176365,"Extra-axial chordomas in the pediatric population are extremely rare and diagnostically challenging; only four cases have been previously reported with ages ranging from 13 to 20 years. We report a primary extra-axial chordoma involving the soft tissue directly dorsal and ulnar to proximal phalanx in the right thumb of a 12-year-old girl who presented with worsening right thumb pain for 1.5 years. The diagnosis was confirmed by excisional biopsy demonstrating proliferation of large, polygonal epithelioid cells with diffuse expression of pan-cytokeratin and brachyury. The patient required repeat excision for local recurrence seven months later. Since then, she has remained disease free through 15 months surveillance. Extra-axial chordomas share the same histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics with their axial counterparts and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any extra-axial bone or soft tissue mass with epithelioid morphology."
33506706,"Background and purpose - Fractures of the pelvis and femur are serious and potentially lethal injuries affecting primarily older, but also younger individuals. Long-term trends on incidence rates and mortality might diverge for these fractures, and few studies compare trends within a complete adult population. We investigated and compared incidence and mortality rates of pelvic, hip, femur shaft, and distal femur fractures in the Swedish adult population.Patients and methods - We analyzed data on all adult patients ≥ 18 years in Sweden with a pelvic, hip, femur shaft, or distal femur fracture, through the Swedish National Patient Register. The studied variables were fracture type, age, sex, and 1-year mortality.Results - While incidence rates for hip fracture decreased by 18% (from 280 to 229 per 105 person-years) from 2001 to 2016, incidence rates for pelvic fracture increased by 25% (from 64 to 80 per 105 person-years). Incidence rates for femur shaft and distal femur fracture remained stable at rates of 15 and 13 per 105 person-years respectively. 1-year mortality after hip fracture was 25%, i.e., higher than for pelvic, femur shaft, and distal femur fracture where mortality rates were 20-21%. Females had an almost 30% lower risk of death within 1 year after hip fracture compared with males.Interpretation - Trends on fracture incidence for pelvic and femur fractures diverged considerably in Sweden between 2001 and 2016. While incidence rates for femur fractures (hip, femur shaft, and distal femur) decreased or remained constant during the studied years, pelvic fracture incidence increased. Mortality rates were different between the fractures, with the highest mortality among patients with hip fracture."

32918112,"We present three adolescents with focal lesions of the distal femur that were shown to be benign aggregates of small lymphocytes and plasma cells of unknown origin. The patients were within the age of 12 and 14 years. All lesions presented with similar MRI findings and provided the same histopathological findings in the biopsy. Although all lesions increased in size, only one patient remained symptomatic and underwent subsequent tumor resection. To our best knowledge, tumor or pseudotumoral epiphyseal lymphoid infiltrates as seen in these three patients have not previously been described. We recommend a biopsy to rule out a malignant tumor or an infection. Observation, without further invasive testing in asymptomatic patients, is recommended until the resolution of the lesions. However, if a lesion becomes symptomatic, surgical resection should be considered."
35998238,"Purpose: During percutaneous pinning of the pediatric distal femur, iatrogenic vascular damage in the medial thigh is a frequent concern. The proximity of a proximal-medial pin to these vessels has never been studied in children. This study describes a radiologic vascular safe zone that is easily visualized during surgery (wherein the superficial femoral vessels are safely posterior). (1). (2) Methods: A retrospective review of all pediatric distal femur fractures treated with percutaneous pinning was performed."
36496339,"Intravascular endothelial hyperplasia is a benign soft tissue mass rarely reported in the foot. Advanced imaging and confirming a benign diagnosis are critical for any soft tissue mass. This paper identifies 2 patients that developed intravascular endothelial hyperplasia tumors which required surgical excision. A 17-year-old male patient presented to clinic complaining of a painful bump to the arch of his right foot which he related to an injury 9 months prior. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right foot revealed a mass within the plantar subcutaneous fat that was serpiginous in nature similar to adjacent branching vessels favoring a low-flow vascular malformation. A 38-year-old female with Multiple Sclerosis presented with complaints of persistent symptoms of pain to the 1st interspace, difficult ambulation and neuritis. Ultrasound and MRI observed solid, multilobulated mass, with internal vascular malformation, MRI describing intrinsic involvement along the abductor musculature and flexor tendons. Both lesions were surgically excised and sent for pathology. Pathology report indicated a diagnosis of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia or Masson's tumor in both cases. Pathology diagnosis of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia is generally good with wide resection leading to low recurrence rates. Both patients in the current study have progressed postoperatively with resolution of symptoms and without recurrence."
33237827,"Objectives: Congenital cholesteatomas originate from epithelial tissue present within the middle ear in patients with an intact tympanic membrane, no history of otologic surgery, otorrhea, or tympanic membrane perforation. They are diagnosed by a pearl-like lesion on otoscopy and computed tomography (CT) scan showing an expansile soft-tissue mass. We describe a series of patients with no prior otologic history presenting with progressive unilateral conductive hearing loss and normal otoscopy. The CT scans showed ossicular erosion without obvious soft-tissue mass. Surgery confirmed incudostapedial erosion found to be cholesteatoma. In this study, we characterize the clinical course of patients diagnosed with isolated incudostapedial cholesteatoma (IIC) and review possible pathologic mechanisms."
33448027,Background and aims: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) generally show an alteration in their fat and soft tissue mass contents. These alterations may influence disease severity and increase the risk of post-operative complications. (1) The aim of this study was to compare the body composition of children with IBD to healthy controls. (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of children with IBD and healthy controls. (3) Results: The study included 50 children with IBD and 50 healthy controls.
30480491,"Purpose To examine if shear-wave elastography (SWE) improves the accuracy of diagnosing soft-tissue masses as benign or malignant compared with US alone or in combination with MRI. Materials and Methods Two hundred six consecutive adult participants (mean age, 57.7 years; range, 18-91 years), including 89 men (median age, 56.0 years; range, 21-91 years) and 117 women (median age, 59.1 years; range, 18-88 years), who were referred for biopsy of a soft-tissue mass were prospectively recruited from December 2015 through March 2017. Participants underwent B-mode US, MRI, and SWE prior to biopsy. Three musculoskeletal radiologists independently reviewed US images alone, followed by US and MRI images together, and classified lesions as benign, probably benign, probably malignant, or malignant. For SWE, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was calculated for transverse shear-wave velocity (SWV). Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between SWE and malignancy alongside individual demographic and imaging variables. Results At histologic examination, 79 of 206 (38%) participants had malignant lesions. SWV showed good diagnostic accuracy for lesions classified as benign or probably benign by US alone (AUC = 0.87 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.79, 0.95]). SWV did not provide substantive diagnostic information for lesions classified as probably malignant or malignant, whether the classification was made with or without MRI. However, multivariable modeling indicated that diagnostic accuracy may vary by lesion position (interaction P =.02; superficial, odds ratio [OR] = 17.7 [95% CI: 1.50, 207], P =.02; deep / mixed, OR = 0.24 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.86], P =.03) and participant age (interaction P =.01; eg, age 43 years, OR = 0.72 [95% CI: 0.15, 3.5], P =.69; age 72 years, OR = 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.37], P =.001). Conclusion Shear-wave elastography can increase accuracy of soft-tissue lesion diagnosis in conjunction with US. However, a single cut-off may not be universally applicable with diagnostic accuracy that is affected by lesion position and patient age. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
32248448,"Objectives: Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) and telangiectatic osteosarcoma (TOS) share several clinical and imaging features, including young presentation, long bone involvement, lytic appearance on radiography and fluid-fluid levels on MRI.

29572568,"Age estimation is an actual topic in the area of forensic medicine with a special focus on the age limits of 16 and 18 years. Current research on this topic relies on retrospective data of inhomogeneous populations relating to sex, age range, and socioeconomic status. In this work, we present a 2-year follow-up study for the evaluation of an age estimation method on a prospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) knee data collective of a homogeneous population. The study includes 40 male subjects from northern Germany aged 14 to 21 years. Three MRI examinations were evenly acquired within 2 years for each subject. As a first evaluation, a three-stage system was used to assess the ossification status of the knee (I: ""open"", II: ""partially ossified"", III: ""fully ossified""). Three raters assessed the growth plate of the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal fibula based on central 2D slices. A good inter-rater agreement was attained (κ = 0.84). All subjects younger than 18 years were rated as stage I and had a cumulative knee score (SKJ) ≤ 5. Based on the follow-up datasets, new parameters quantifying the intra-individual ossification process were calculated. The results of this follow-up analysis show a different start, end, and speed of each growth plate's maturation as well as an ossification peak for individuals at the age of 16. The generated MRI database provides new insights into the ossification process over time and serves as a basis for further evaluations of age estimation methods."
31630689,Background: The treatment of aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) has evolved and less invasive methods have been tried. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody which inhibits osteoclasts. It has been shown to be effective in giant cell tumour of bone (GCT) of bone and hence promises some effect also in ABC. We report on 6 patients treated with Denosumab and compare our results to the cases already published. (1) Methods: Six patients with ABC were treated with Denosumab.
33482784,"Background: Synchronous multicentric osteosarcoma (SMOS) is a rare disease characterized by simultaneous multicentricity of intraosseous osteosarcoma without visceral involvement. SMOS, including a skull lesion, which occurs relatively rarely, and reconstruction using a frozen autograft after the excision of a lesion of SMOS has been infrequently reported previously. (1) We report a case of SMOS with a skull lesion that was successfully treated with a frozen autograft. (2) Case presentation: A 21-year-old man presented with a right parietal bone tumor."

30849068,"BACKGROUND Trochlear dysplasia (TD) often leads to anatomic variations of the knee. Little is known about the association of TD and tibiofemoral joint morphology in adolescent. MATERIAL AND METHODS Computed tomography scans of 35 knees with TD and 55 knees with well-developed patella-femoral joint were analyzed randomly and retrospectively. Two researchers evaluated the posterior tibial slope (PTS), distal femoral rotation, proximal tibia varus angle, and femoral anteversion between the 2 groups. The independent Student's t-test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of variables. RESULTS The study group had a smaller lateral PTS (4.7 ± 2.97) than the control group (6.96 ± 3.05) (P < 0.01), while the medial PTS showed consistent values between the control and the study group (non-significant). Patients with TD had smaller external rotation of the distal femur (2.69 ± 0.93) compared to the control group (3.77 ± 1.46) (P < 0.01). In addition, the study group showed a bigger proximal tibia varus angle (4.46 ± 1.09) compared to the control group (3.35 ± 0.76) (P < 0.01). The femoral anteversion in the study group (17.46 ± 9.95) was increased compared to the control group (12.22 ± 5.39) (P < 0.01). The femoral anteversion and distal femoral rotation in patients with TD showed a positive correlation (r ² = 0.326; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Patients with TD had flatter lateral PTS compared to those without TD, but there were no differences in the medial PTS between the two groups. Patients with TD had smaller distal femoral rotation and bigger proximal tibia varus angle. The femoral anteversion in patients with TD was bigger than those without TD, and there was a positive correlation between the femoral anteversion and the external rotation of the distal femoral in the study group."
33635286,"Background: Large, malignant bone tumors and revision limb salvage procedures often result in the resection of extensive lengths of the involved bone segment, leaving a residual segment of bone that may be too short to support a standard intramedullary stem for endoprosthetic reconstruction. Telescope allografting, in which an allograft is used to augment the remaining bone segment by telescoping it into the residual bone segment, was described for situations in which residual bone stock is insufficient after tumor resection or prosthetic revision. Apart from one study that first described the procedure [15], there are no other studies reporting the outcome of this telescopic concept for restoring bone stock."
33148968,"Age estimation in forensic medicine practice is of particular importance to the legal systems, and it is one of the current research topics in forensic medicine. Age determination is most frequently performed by radiological methods, but recently, nonionized methods are preferred for nonmedical indications. Therefore, we aimed to examine feasibility of MRI imaging, which provides nonionized, noninvasive, and detailed images, in forensic age estimation and to expand the database on this subject. The MRI images of the patients between the ages of 10 and 25 years, who visited Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine between January 2012 and April 2018 for any reason, were retrospectively analyzed according to the staging method described by Dedouit et al. The stage 5 ossification in distal femoral epiphysis indicated an age over 18 years in both sexes (except for 2 cases of 14 and 15 years). The stage 5 ossification in proximal tibial epiphysis indicated an age older than 18 years (except for 1 male case at the age of 15 years and 2 female cases at the age of 14 and 17 years, respectively). It was determined that stage 1 and stage 2 in both distal femur and proximal tibial epiphysis were last seen in younger than 18 years in both sexes. Our study data show that MRI imaging is a nonionized method that can be used in addition to other radiological methods in determining the age limit of 18 years."
36801962,"Background: Although body composition is an important determinant of pediatric health outcomes, we lack tools to routinely assess it in clinical practice. We define models to predict whole-body skeletal muscle and fat composition, as measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in pediatric oncology and healthy pediatric cohorts, respectively.

33202393,"Objective: Phase angle (PA), a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameter, has proven to be a proxy of body cell mass in athletes, but very few data are available on its segmental evaluation (upper and lower limbs). Therefore, we aimed to assess whether whole-body and segmental PA varied among elite male athletes of different sports and compared these to control groups. Additionally, we investigated its relationship with anthropometric and body composition parameters. (1) Methods: We recruited a total of 60 elite male athletes (soccer, basketball, volleyball, and handball) and 60 healthy controls (matched for age, height, and body mass)."
34888155,"Background: Multiple exostoses generally develop in the first decade of life. They most frequently arise from the distal femur, proximal tibia, fibula, and proximal humerus. Costal exostoses are rare, contributing to 1% -2% of all exostoses in hereditary multiple exostoses (HME). They are usually asymptomatic, but a few cases have resulted in severe thoracic injuries. Pneumothorax caused by costal exostoses is rare, with only 13 previously reported cases. We report a new case of pneumothorax caused by costal exostoses."
30531251,Background: Fixed knee flexion deformity is common in children with neuromuscular disorders. Anterior guided growth (AGG) of the distal femur can achieve gradual correction in patients who are skeletally immature. Little outcome data are available on this procedure.

(2) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients who underwent AGG for fixed knee flexion deformity in our institution between January 2000 and December 2014.
37510201,"Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a benign condition caused by the inoculation of Bartonella henselae. The imaging findings are non-specific, and it is difficult to diagnose the disease via imaging. However, imaging studies help exclude other differential diagnoses in diagnostic dilemmas. We encountered a case of a 17-year-old adolescent who presented with painful neck swelling. CT showed multiple bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies with triangular soft tissue mass at the anterior mediastinum likely to be thymic hyperplasia, which is unusual in CSD and was mistaken for a lymphoproliferative disorder. Tissue diagnosis with a thorough clinical history yielded the diagnosis of cat scratch disease, and follow-up imaging showed resolution of the cervical lymphadenopathy and thymic hyperplasia."
31181027,"Background: nonossifying fibroma (noF) is the most common benign osseous lesion in children; however, our understanding of which lesions progress to a fracture remains unclear. In this study, we seek to formulate a classification system for noFs to assess for fracture risk and determine what this classification system tells us regarding fracture risk of the distal tibia and distal femur noFs. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent surgical treatment for a noF of the distal tibia or distal femur between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015."
30839485,Background: Chondroblastoma is a rare cartilaginous benign bone tumor that commonly arises in long bones of young people. Surgical management is the primary treatment of choice for chondroblastoma and it entails adequate intralesional curettage alone or in combination with adjuvants. This study was performed to describe the epidemiological characteristics and clinical and radiologic results of intralesional curettage of chondroblastoma.

36848028,"Background: Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor that can present with pain in the bones, joints, and local masses. The incidence is highest in adolescents, and the most common sites are the distal femur, proximal tibia and proximal humerus metaphyseal. Doxorubicin is the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of osteosarcoma, but it has many side effects. Cannabidiol is a non-psychoactive plant cannabinoid cannabinol (CBD) that has been shown to be effective against osteosarcoma; however, the molecular targets and mechanisms of CBD action in osteosarcoma remain unclear."
35171125,"Background: Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are more common diagnoses in preadolescent and adolescent children compared with the adult population. A greater percentage of patients are treated with limb salvage and reconstruction using modular tumor endoprostheses. Implant-to-bone fixation can be cemented or cementless. Cementless tumor endoprostheses rely on biologic osteointegration for implant stability, and chemotherapy during childhood and adolescence can disturb the bone turnover rate and reduce bone mineral density, which in turn may predispose patients with uncemented endoprostheses to a high rate of revision surgeries."

34111983,"Approximately 40% of conventional chondrosarcomas arise from the shoulder girdle, chest wall and pelvis. This pictorial review describes the MRI features which may aid in the differentiation of Grade 1 chondrosarcoma (Gd1-CS) from high-grade chondrosarcoma (HG-CS) and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (DD-CS) in these locations, based on literature review and assessment of 111 consecutive cases presenting to the senior authors institution over a 13-year period. Of the 111 patients reviewed (71 males and 40 females; mean age 54.3 years; range 17-92 years), 27 were Gd1-CS, 72 were HG-CS and 12 were DD-CS. Tumours arising from the scapula, acetabulum, pubis / ischium and sacrum were more likely to be HG-CS, as were intramedullary tumours. MRI features associated with HG-CS and DD-CS included cortical destruction, bone oedema, soft tissue oedema, tumour necrosis, intermediate T2W SI and joint invasion. The presence of a soft tissue mass became a significant differentiating feature for tumours arising within the medullary cavity, but this was location-specific and did not differentiate between Gd1-CS and HG-CS / DD-CS arising from the sternum or clavicle."
32317562,"Fractures of the distal femur carry a significant risk of physeal arrest and resulting growth complications which often require additional surgeries to correct the deformity. This study examines the risk of needing corrective procedures as a child approaches skeletal maturity. A retrospective analysis of patients treated at a single institution for distal femoral physeal fractures from 2000 to 2015 was performed. Association between sex, age, Salter-Harris (SH) class, and fracture displacement with the risk of physeal arrest were examined. Association between years of growth remaining to skeletal maturity and the risk of needing additional corrective surgery (defined by leg length difference > 2 cm or angular deformity (> 5 °) was examined using a logistic regression model. One hundred one patients were available for review with an average age of 12.6 ± 3.2 years. Twenty-six patients (25.7%) developed a physeal arrest. Seventy-six percent of these required subsequent surgical intervention to address length and angular deformities Sex, age, and SH class were not significantly associated with physeal arrest (P > 0.05). Percent fracture displacement was significantly associated with physeal arrest (P = 0.02). Years of growth remaining to skeletal maturity were significantly associated with an increased risk of requiring corrective surgery for growth complications (odds ratio: 0.758; 95% confidence interval 0.587-0.979; P = 0.03), however, this association failed to persist when accounting for age. Years of growth remaining to skeletal maturity may predict the need for future interventions and should be accounted for when planning treatment of these challenging injuries."
34748525,"Background: Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data can be fused to identify the tumor boundaries. This enables surgeons to set close but tumor-free surgical margins and excise the tumor more precisely.

37210457,"Morphological parameters of knee joint are related to race and nationality. At present, knee prosthesis come from white male population. Due to the mismatch between the prosthesis and other ethnic groups, the prosthesis life span is reduced, revision surgery and the patients' economic burden are increased. There is no data of the Mongolian ethnic group. In order to treat patients more accurately, we measured the Mongolian data of the femoral condyle. A total of 122 knee joints were scanned in 61 volunteers (21 males and 40 females) with an average age of 23.259 ± 1.395 years. The Mimics software was used to reconstruct the 3D image and measure the data of each line. The data were analyzed by statistical methods such as t test, and P < 0.05 was taken as the significant. 122 normal femoral condyle data were obtained. The mean transverse diameter of femoral condyle is 76.472 ± 5.952 mm, medial condyle is 29.259 ± 11.461 mm, and the sagittal diameter of the medial condyle was 56.758 ± 4.163 mm.

(1) There was no statistical significance in the left and right knee joint data (P > 0.05). (2) The different genders data of femoral condyle were statistically significant (P < 0.05). (3) Compared with other nationalities and races, the data of femoral condyle are different. (4) There are differences between femoral surface ratio and mainstream prosthesis data."
33434767,"Introduction: Front-line biopsy remains the rule in the management of soft tissue mass syndromes. Although open biopsy has long been considered the gold standard, it has recently been shown that a percutaneous biopsy is associated with a reduction in the rate of complications and cost, while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Though there is much literature regarding the diagnostic accuracy of image-guided and open biopsies for soft tissue tumors, the accuracy of percutaneous non image-guided biopsies has not been well documented. The objective of this study was to compare the failure rate of non image-guided biopsies, image-guided biopsies and open biopsies for the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors. We also attempted to identify the failure risk factors for non image-guided biopsies and we compared the diagnostic delay of the three types of biopsy."
33010775,Background: Gait alterations have been studied with computer-assisted gait analysis after megaprosthetic replacement for tumors around the knee. It has never been proven that megaprostheses affects gait more than total knee arthroplasty (TKA); this study aims to compare via gait analysis patients who underwent megaprosthesis with patients with TKA. (1) The primary outcome is the difference in gait speed. (2) The secondary outcome is the difference in gait speed and gait variability.

36915189,"Background bcor: CCNB3 sarcoma is a rare mesenchymal tumor that was formerly included in the undifferentiated / unclassified sarcoma group and was recently reclassified as one of undifferentiated small round cell sarcomas with a genetically distinct subtype in the WHO 2020 classification. Because of its rarity, still not much is known, especially about its clinical features. CASE REPORT A 15-year-old boy presented with almost 1-year intermittent thigh pain. On the first visit, a pathologic fracture of the femur and a big mass expanding through the femoral cortex with lobular shape and homogenous appearance were recognized on radiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Plain radiography, which was taken 6 months before at a local clinic, showed an expansion and thickening of the right proximal femoral shaft. Biopsy specimen of the lesion revealed a proliferation of round to spindle tumor cells with diffuse and strong immunohistochemical nuclear positivity for BCOR and CCNB3. Under the diagnosis of BCOR:: CCNB3 sarcoma of the femur, a chemotherapy based on a protocol of Ewing sarcoma, followed by a wide resection and total femoral replacement surgery, were conducted. The effect of chemotherapy was favorable, showing no microscopic residual tumor. Although postoperative chemotherapy was not completed because of a minor infection detected on the surgical site, the patient was doing well, without any recurrence, for 26 months."
37496022,"Background: Joint-salvage surgery has been proposed in children with metaphysis malignancy of the distal femur. However, there is still some drawbacks regarding to the surgical technique and endoprosthetic design.

32544036,"Background Tumor-like cortical irregularities at the posterior distal femur are common incidental findings in adolescents, but the origin of these irregularities is debated. Purpose To compare the prevalence of distal femoral cortical irregularities (DFCIs) at different tendon attachment sites in youth competitive alpine skiers with that in young adults. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of a prospective trial, unenhanced 3-T knee MRI scans obtained in youth competitive alpine skiers were compared with images in control participants of the same age from 2014 to 2019 (Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich registry number: KEK-ZH-2017-01395) for presence of DFCIs at the femoral attachment of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle (MHG) and / or lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle (LHG) and adductor magnus tendon by two radiologists. DFCI size and tendon attachment position were measured. Tendon attachment position and associated MRI findings (meniscus, cartilage, bone marrow edema, joint effusion, ligaments, tendons) were examined for an association with DFCI. Pearson χ2, Student t test, logistic regression, and κ statistics were applied. Results Unilateral knee MRI scans obtained in 105 skiers (mean age, 14.8 years ± 0.6 [standard deviation]; 66 boys) and in 105 control participants (mean age, 14.6 years ± 0.5; 59 boys) were evaluated. DFCIs were found in 61 of 105 skiers (58%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.5%, 67.2%) compared with 28 of 105 control participants (27%; 95% CI: 18.9%, 35.7%) (P <.001). Two skiers had more than one DFCI. Distribution of DFCIs for skiers and control participants was 60 of 63 (95.2%) and 26 of 28 (92.8%) at the MHG, three of 63 (4.8%) and one of 28 (3.6%) at the LHG, and zero of 63 (0%) and one of 28 (3.6%) at the adductor magnus attachment site, respectively. Interreader agreement was almost perfect (κ = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.93). The mean size of MHG-related DFCIs in skiers (3.7 mm) was not different compared to the size of those in control participants (3.4 mm) (P =.32), nor was a difference found for the MHG tendon attachment position in knees with DFCI (63.9 mm vs 63.0 mm, P =.83) or without DF"

35797610,Biopsy site infection in the setting of osteosarcoma is a potentially devastating complication. We present the case of a 16-year-old adolescent girl with a distal femur osteosarcoma who developed an open biopsy site ulceration and infection after initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This was treated with careful local excision of the ulcerated biopsy site and systemic antibiotic therapy throughout the duration of her chemotherapy course. She subsequently underwent wide resection of the tumor en bloc with a generous ellipse around the biopsy scar and reconstruction with cemented knee megaprosthesis. no recurrence of either infection or malignancy was observed. This case represents the successful treatment of a biopsy site ulceration and infection in a patient with osteosarcoma and may merit adoption in future instances of this complication.

36988525,"Introduction: Benign bone tumours occur most commonly during the first through third decades of life and often weaken the bones, which may predispose them to pathological fractures. Great diversity and debate in the management of primary bone tumours are based on the tumour extent. There has been an increasing trend toward the intra-operative filling of these lesions. We hypothesised that in some benign bone tumours, filling the resulting cavity after curettage was unnecessary. This study was carried out to determine whether it is necessary to fill the resultant cavity after the curettage of benign bone tumours and to represent various fillers."

30762800,"Surgical-site infection (SSI) is a common complication in orthopedic surgery; however, SSI after surgically managed distal femur fractures was not well studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of SSI and identify some modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors.The patients' electronic medical records (EMRs) were reviewed to identify those who sustained a distal femur fracture and treated by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) between March 2014 and February 2018. SSI was defined based on the Centers for Disease Control criteria and confirmed according to the descriptions in EMR. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the independent risk factors associated with SSI.Totally, EMRs of 665 patients who underwent ORIF of distal femur fractures were reviewed and 24 SSIs were found, indicating the overall incidence of SSI was 3.6%. The rate of deep SSI was 1.2% and superficial SSI was 2.4%. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common causative pathogen, either alone (7 / 15, 46.7%) or as a mixed infection (3 / 15, 20%), followed by mixed bacterial (4 / 15, 26.7%) and S epidermidis (2 / 15, 13.3%) and others. Patients with SSI had approximately twice the length of hospital stay as those without SSIs (29.0 vs 16.0 days, P <.001). Open fracture, temporary use of external fixation, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and preoperative reduced albumin level were identified as independent risk factors associated with SSI, and current smoking and preoperative reduced albumin level were the true modifiable factors.Patients should be encouraged to cease smoking as early as possible and increase the good-quality protein intake to reduce or prevent the occurrence of SSI. An explanation of the nonmodifiable risk factors should be included when patients are counseled about their increased risk of SSI."

34766564,"There has been no study evaluating the change of limb alignment for patients with genu valgum. The purpose of this study was to investigate the change of limb alignments in children and adolescents with idiopathic genu valgum through evaluating distal femur, proximal tibia, and knee joint line.Consecutive children and adolescents, under the age of 18, with genu valgum were included. Mechanical tibiofemoral angle, mechanical lateral distal femoral angle, mechanical medial proximal tibia angle, and joint line convergence angle were measured. The rate of changes for each radiographic measurement were analyzed using a linear mixed model.A total of 1539 teleroentgenograms from 518 limbs of 273 individuals were included in this study. Linear mixed model showed that the change of limb alignment was significantly associated with age, but not associated with gender and laterality. The mechanical tibiofemoral angle was most valgus initially, decreasing until reaching its lowest value of 2.8 ° at 10 years old. The mechanical lateral distal femoral angle decreases from initial neutral alignment and increases in valgus continuously. The mechanical medial proximal tibia angle decreases from initial valgus and progresses to be neutral at around the age of 10. The joint line convergence angle decreases sharply from initial valgus alignment to 0 ° at the age of 5.Valgus alignment in children with idiopathic genu valgum decreases until approximately the age of 10. In younger children, the tibia and joint line contribute most to overall valgus alignment; in older children, the femur contributes the most. Based on our results, we recommend monitoring patient limb alignment until it stabilizes around the age of 10, and then carefully planning and performing corrective surgery with complete consideration of the changing bony alignment."

35388316,"Adolescents and children worldwide are threatened by osteosarcoma, a tumor that predominantly affects the long bone epiphysis. Osteosarcoma is the most common and highly malignant bone tumor in youngsters. Early tumor detection is the key to effective treatment of this disease. The discovery of biomarkers and the growing understanding of molecules and their complex interactions have improved the outcome of clinical trials in osteosarcoma. This article describes biomarkers of osteosarcoma with the aim of positively influencing the progress of clinical treatment of osteosarcoma. Femoral bone tumor is a typical condition of osteosarcoma. Due to the wide range of femoral stem types, complexities in the distal femur, and tumors in the rotor part of femur, physicians following the traditional clinical approach face difficulties in removing the lesion and fixing the femur with resection of the tumor segment. In this paper, the effect of small doses of different concentrations of lidocaine anesthesia in patients undergoing lumpectomy for osteosarcoma femoral tumor segments is investigated. A computer-based artificial intelligence method for automated determination of different concentration levels of lidocaine anesthesia and amputation of osteosarcoma femoral tumor segment is proposed. Statistical analysis is carried on the empirical data including intraoperative bleeding, intraoperative and postoperative pain scores, surgical operation time, postoperative complications, patient satisfaction, and local anesthetic dose. The results showed that the patients in the study group had low intraoperative bleeding, short operation time, low postoperative hematoma formation rate, high patient satisfaction, higher dosage of anesthetic solution, and low dosage of lidocaine. Results revealed that mean arterial pressure and heart rate in extubating and intubating were significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group, and a significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed between the two groups. This proves that the proposed algorithm can adequately reduce bleeding, alleviate postoperative pain, shorten operation time, reduce complications, accelerate recovery, and ensure better treatment results."
33380180,Aims: Local recurrence remains a challenging and common problem following curettage and joint-sparing surgery for giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB). We previously reported a 15% local recurrence rate at a median follow-up of 30 months in 20 patients with high-risk GCTB treated with neoadjuvant Denosumab. The aim of this study was to determine if this initial favourable outcome following the use of Denosumab was maintained with longer follow-up.
36438027,"Background: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a common pleomorphic malignant soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents that originates from rhabdomyoblasts or mesenchymal precursor cells. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) mostly occurs in adolescents aged 10-15 years and is characterized by more aggressive behaviors and worse prognosis than other sarcomas, prone to lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis in the early stage as well as metastasizing to breast, testis, pancreas, and other parts. ARMS often occurs in the limbs and genitourinary system, however, head and neck ARMS are relatively rare when involving the nasal cavity or sinuses. The role of MRI and 18F-FDG positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET / CT) remains to be established in ARMS."
