37405817,"Background: Rarely, traumatic sternum fractures may result in nonunion, which can have drastic, negative implications. Literature on traumatic sternal nonunion reconstruction outcomes is limited to case reports. We present the surgical principles and report clinical outcomes for 7 patients following surgical reconstruction of a traumatic sternal body nonunion. (1) Methods: A retrospective review of 7 patients who underwent sternal body nonunion reconstruction at a single institution was performed. (1) Results: The mean age of the patients was 58.5 years (range, 42-77 years)."
32649563,"Purpose: Motor vehicle collisions (MVC) are a leading cause of unintentional death and injury in the US pediatric population. Compliance with prevention measures such as seatbelts and child safety seats varies considerably with patient demographics. In this study, the authors examine facial fracture secondary to MVC in an urban pediatric population. (1) Methods: A retrospective review of all patients aged 0-18 years who sustained facial fractures secondary to MVC from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015 was performed."
35012752,"Background: The aim of this study was to provide a description of vascular trauma and its management at trauma centers across Canada. (1) Methods: A retrospective review of all patients with vascular trauma admitted to trauma centers across Canada between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015, was performed. (2) Results: A total of 524 patients were admitted with vascular trauma. (1) Conclusions: Vascular trauma is a rare but important cause of trauma-related morbidity and mortality."
34560220,"Objective: Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) is the second leading cause of death from blunt trauma. In the present study, we aimed to determine the outcomes of medical management (MM) for BTAI. We hypothesized from the results of several previously reported studies, that patients with a minimal aortic injury (BTAI grades 1 and 2) could safely be treated with definitive MM alone. (1) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with BTAI admitted to our institution between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015."

(1) Methods: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to the Jamaican General Hospital from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014 was conducted. (2) Results: A total of 59,960 patients were admitted to the hospital during the study period."
30910750,"Objective: Spine trauma management in children varies from one team to another, and to date, no clear consensus has been reached. The goal of this study was to describe the epidemiology of spine trauma in children and evaluate the timing and techniques of surgery when it was required. (1) Methods: A retrospective review of all patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent spine surgery for spine trauma at a single institution from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2015, was performed."
35186134,"A dedicated network-based trauma system ensures optimal care to injured patients. Considering the significant burden of trauma, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is striving to develop a nationwide trauma system. This article describes the recent design, development, and implementation of the Saudi Arabian trauma system in line with Vision 2030. The basis of our strategy was the find, organize, clarify, understand, select-plan, do, check, and act (FOCUS-PDCA) model, developed by engaging key stakeholders, including patients. More than 300 healthcare professionals and patients from around the Riyadh region assessed the current system with three solutions and roadmap workshops. Subsequently, the national clinical advisory group (CAG) for trauma was formed to develop the Saudi Arabian trauma system, and CAG members analyzed and collated internationally recognized trauma systems and guidelines. The guidelines' applicability in the kingdom was discussed and reviewed, and an interactive document was developed to support socialization and implementation. The CAG team members agreed on the guiding principles for the trauma pathway, identified the challenges, and finalized the new system design. They also developed a trauma care standard document to support and guide the rollout of new trauma networks across the kingdom. The CAG members and other stakeholders are at the forefront of implementing the trauma system across the Riyadh region. Recent trauma system development in Saudi Arabia is the first step in improving national trauma care and may guide development in other locations, regionally and internationally, to improve outcomes."
30739872,"Introduction: Urinary bladder ruptures are an uncommon injury, occurring in less than 1% of all blunt abdominal trauma. Extraperitoneal bladder ruptures are generally associated with pelvic fractures and usually managed nonoperatively. Conversely, intraperitoneal injuries are often caused by large compressive and shear forces produced during seatbelt injuries and almost invariably require surgical intervention. (1) The purpose of this study was to review our experience with urinary bladder ruptures in patients with blunt abdominal trauma. (2) Methods: A retrospective review of all patients with urinary bladder ruptures from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 was performed."
34178201,"Pelvic fractures and sacroiliac joint (SI) diastasis are debilitating injuries which can drastically decrease an individual's functional capacity, and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. In younger, healthier populations, pelvic fractures are usually the result of sudden traumatic forces, such as a motor vehicle collision. Atraumatic pelvic fractures can also occur, and are most commonly due to age related changes and osteoporosis. Even with prompt surgical management, pelvic fractures often result in a host of challenging complications such as disruption of the SI joint with subsequent limitations in mobility and chronic pain. In this case report, we present a novel treatment of SI diastasis, secondary to corticosteroid induced osteoporosis and pelvic fractures. We performed percutaneous bilateral poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) SI joint fusions under CT-guidance. Here we describe a case of bilateral SI joint CT guided percutaneous arthroplasty for osteoporotic SI joint diastasis and pelvic fractures, resulting in a rapid resolution of SI joint pain and restoration of the ability to ambulate in a previously wheelchair-bound patient. This may be of particular benefit in patients who are poor surgical candidates who experience osteoporotic fractures and would be otherwise unable to receive definitive operative management of their pathologic fractures."
35856824,"Background: Development of the craniofacial skeleton and different mechanisms of injury warrant different treatment paradigms for younger children versus those at skeletal maturity. Objective: To characterize the mechanism, fracture patterns, and management of mandible fractures across the pediatric age spectrum. Methods: A 10-year retrospective review of < 18-year-old children with mandible fractures at a level 1 trauma center. Characteristics were compared by age subgroup analysis. Results: Of 220 patients meeting inclusion criteria, motor vehicle collision (n = 53, 40.8%), falls (n = 48, 36.9%), and assault (n = 19, 14.6%) were the most common mechanisms with more falls in younger children and more injury by assault in teenagers. Condylar fractures were most common in the 0- to < 9-year-old children (n = 27, 38.4%); angle / ramus fractures (56, 62.6%) were most common in 15- to < 18-year-old children (p < 0.001). Nonsurgical management was associated with younger age (p < 0.001). Fourteen of 125 patients (8.0%) undergoing surgical intervention experienced complications. Being uninsured was associated with shorter median (interquartile range) follow-up of 5.6 (1.4-10.7) weeks, compared with private [11.9 (4.3-49.0) weeks] and public insurance [11.7 (3.7-218.0) weeks] (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The mechanism, fracture sites, and treatment differed by age with the youngest frequently managed nonoperatively and teenagers treated with adult algorithms. Complications were rare overall within 6-12 weeks after injury, with or without surgical management."
36105838,"Rupture of the right ventricular (RV) myocardium is associated with serious morbidity and mortality. Under very rare conditions, a tear in the ventricular wall can lead to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm: an external outpouching of the ventricle that is stabilized by the pericardium, thrombus formation, and / or adhesions. Here, we present a 75-year-old man with RV free wall rupture with pseudoaneurysm following a motor vehicle collision. With concerns for blunt cardiac trauma, initial CTA chest revealed focal outpouching and extension of contrast outside of the confines of the RV chamber, compatible with pseudoaneurysm formation. In this case, conservative management of the pseudoaneurysm was preferred over surgical management, due to the thin RV free wall and present comorbid conditions. We highlight how CTA chest offers a reliable tool for tracking the stability of pseudoaneurysms in the RV and can guide clinical management through directing treatment strategies and appropriate follow-up intervals."
36103319,"Background: Traumatic thoracic spondyloptosis (TTS) is a rare but devastating spinal injury often secondary to high-impact trauma. TTS is typically managed with surgical fusion and stabilization. (1) The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and surgical management of TTS. (2) Methods: A retrospective review of patients with TTS was performed at a single institution. (3) Results: A total of 11 patients were identified."
34152863,"Background: Pancreatic trauma surgery is a complicated surgical procedure for severe pancreatic injuries, accompanied by a high incidence of complications and mortality. This study was designed to explore the long-term prognosis of pancreatic surgery because of abdominal trauma. Patients and Methods: The clinical data of 103 patients who were admitted to Jinling Hospital between August 2012 and August 2019 who had pancreatic trauma surgery were analyzed retrospectively. Results: All admissions involved pancreatic trauma surgery performed at an outside hospital network, which later transferred patients to our institution because of post-operative later-stage complications. Eight patients received American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade 1 or 2 pancreatic injuries and 95 received AAST grade 3, 4, or 5 pancreatic injuries. The primary surgical management of pancreatic injuries included drainage of the pancreatic injury (n = 28), repair of the pancreas (n = 35), partial pancreatectomy (n = 15), pancreaticojejunostomy (n = 6), and pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 19). The most common mechanism of trauma was motor vehicle collision (n = 72), crush injury (n = 26), and stab wound (n = 5). Of 103 patients suffered varying degrees of gastrointestinal fistulae and intra-abdominal infections, there were 66 cases of pancreatic fistulae (64.1%), 49 cases of enteric fistulae (47.6%), 26 cases of colonic fistulae (25.2%), 14 cases of gastric or gastrointestinal anastomotic fistulae (13.6%), and 13 cases of biliary fistulae (12.6%). Ninety-five patients survived and eight patients died after therapy; the mean length of intensive care unit stay was 33 days. The number of patients who underwent emergency pancreaticoduodenectomy (EPD), the incidence of blood transfusion, the number of fistulae per patient, and the duration of mechanical ventilation and bacteremia in the mortality group were substantially higher than in the survival group (p < 0.05 each). The patients who underwent EPD had more grade 5 pancreatic injuries, more blood transfusions, higher peak total bilirubin, greater numbers of fistulae and open abdomen, and longer duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality than other patients (p < 0.05 each). Conclusions: The grade of pancreatic injury was associated with mortality and post-operative complications. The post-operative mortality and occurrence of complications of EPD because of abdominal trauma were significant; use of damage control surgery could potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality related to this procedure."
34562724,"Introduction and importance: The ideal treatment of proximal humerus fracture remains a controversial topic, especially in the case of complex multi-fragmentary fractures. However, in limited resource settings, alternative less complicated fixation may be considered in highly selected patients without compromising the functional outcome. We report a case of successful treatment with k-wire fixation with satisfactory functional outcome. (1) Case presentation: A 45-year-old male presented with a comminuted proximal humerus fracture with a large tuberosity fragment."
30775107,"Background Trauma in pregnancy can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. Conventional treatments of hemorrhage include medical and surgical management. However, if these measures fail uterine compression is an option to control bleeding. We present a case where this management was employed. Case A patient presented at 36 weeks of gestation with multiple injuries after a motor vehicle collision and experienced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The use of a Bakri balloon in combination with external compression with Coban, a sterile self-adherent bandage, after delivery temporized her bleeding and allowed her to become stable for further management. Conclusion When other measures fail and a hysterectomy is considered unsafe, the combination of internal and external uterine compression is an option."
31338407,"Acetabular fractures are injuries that require significant force transmission, especially when associated with a femoral head dislocation. The mechanism of injury is typically in the setting of a high-speed motor vehicle collision. In a similar manner, this is an injury that is highly demanding for the orthopaedic trauma surgeon to treat as well. We present a patient who sustained an initial posterior wall acetabular fracture with an associated posterior dislocation. This was treated surgically with open reduction, internal fixation without complication. The patient subsequently sustained a second posterior wall acetabular fracture with dislocation fifteen years later through the plated and healed previous fracture. Both injuries were sustained in high-speed motor vehicle collisions, so it is difficult to presume the patient was predisposed for the repeat injury. At any rate, the repeat injury makes the surgical management significantly more challenging. In complicated acetabular fractures like these, a post or intra-operative CT scan can be of utility to determine quality of reduction as well as assessing for retained bony fragments. Our patient underwent a post-operative CT scan with the finding of intra-articular bony fragments that subsequently required arthroscopic removal. Given the rare nature of this complicated injury occurring twice in a patient, it is difficult to make evidence-based comments on long-term prognosis and functional outcomes. This unique case and the applied treatment will serve as a guide for future similar cases."
30788109,Objectives: Spine injuries seldom affect the subaxial spine in children less than 9 years of age. We describe the management of a chronic paediatric bilateral facet dislocation. (1) Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed. (2) Results: A total of 11 patients were identified. (1) Conclusion: The management of paediatric bilateral facet dislocations is challenging. (3) Conclusion: The management of paediatric bilateral facet dislocations is challenging.
37546026,"The liver is one of the most commonly injured solid organs in blunt abdominal trauma. In patients who are hemodynamically normal, most cases of blunt liver injuries are managed conservatively. At present, nonoperative management (NOM) is the standard of care for both minor and severe liver injuries. Usually, patients with severe liver injuries, i.e., grades IV and V, are treated with surgical intervention versus angioembolization depending if patients are hemodynamically stable or not. We present a hemodynamically stable 53-year-old male patient with a grade V blunt liver injury with complete avulsion of the left lobe of the liver after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). Very few cases of complete hepatic avulsions have been published in the literature. We discuss surgical management with stapler-assisted hepatectomy in emergency trauma laparotomy for bleeding control."
32224680,"Case: A 19-year-old woman sustained a plantar flexion-inversion injury to her right ankle after a low-speed motor vehicle collision. Clinical examination demonstrated supinated, adducted deformity of the foot, and prominent calcaneus laterally. Radiographs revealed dislocation of the calcaneocuboid joint, a rare injury, which was successfully stabilized by a novel technique using a hamstring allograft. The presentations and clinical and surgical management of this rare condition are discussed."
