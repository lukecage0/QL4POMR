23388234,"Acute pericarditis is a rare complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Here, we describe a case of PCI complicated by guidewire perforation and contrast extravasation. Acute pericarditis developed 36 hours after PCI procedure with fever and severe chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in inferior-lateral leads. However, the follow-up coronary angiography showed negative result and the symptom improved dramatically with the treatment of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment. Therefore, it is important for the clinician to differentiate acute myocardial infarction / acute stent thrombosis from this rare complication after PCI."
17921916,"Introduction / aim: Patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI) and patients with left ventricular myocardial infarction (LVMI) of the anterior wall with ST-elevation (STEMI), due to the profundity and volume of the necrosis, tend to have a more severe and more complicated clinical outcome as well as a higher mortality level compared to patients with myocardial infarction of inferoposterior localization in the left ventricle (IPILK), without the right ventricle being overtaken. C-Reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive and reliable indicator of acute inflammation and is in good correlation with creatin kinasis (CK) or the enzymes which indicate necrosis markers in acute myocardial infarction (AIM). Because of this, a common biohumoral answer is of greater importance and more reliable both diagnostically and prognostically; it signifies a more severe and more complicated clinical outcome, especially on the rupture of the myocardium. The main goal of this study was to compare the maximum values of enzymes and CRP in patients with RVMI and LVMI who had first STEMI and who were in the acute phase treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)."
34067941,"Background: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is known as a very rare possible trigger of pericarditis. Most frequently it develops after a latent period or early in the case of periprocedural complications. In this report, we present an atypical early onset of pericarditis after an uncomplicated PCI. (1) Case summary: A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with unstable angina pectoris. (2) He had undergone PCI for a left anterior descending artery (LAD) lesion."
35018605,"Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) has significantly contributed to reducing the mortality of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) even in cardiogenic shock and is now the standard of care in most of Japanese institutions. The Task Force on Primary PCI of the Japanese Association of Cardiovascular Interventional and Therapeutics (CVIT) society proposed an expert consensus document for the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) focusing on procedural aspects of primary PCI in 2018. Updated guidelines for the management of AMI were published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2017 and 2020. Major changes in the guidelines for STEMI patients included: (1) radial access and drug-eluting stents (DES) over bare-metal stents (BMS) were recommended as a Class I indication, (2) complete revascularization before hospital discharge (either immediate or staged) is now considered as Class IIa recommendation. In 2020, updated guidelines for non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) patients, the followings were changed: (1) an early invasive strategy within 24 h is recommended in patients with NSTEMI as a Class I indication, (2) complete revascularization in NSTEMI patients without cardiogenic shock is considered as Class IIa recommendation, and (3) in patients with atrial fibrillation following a short period of triple antithrombotic therapy, dual antithrombotic therapy (e.g., DOAC and single oral antiplatelet agent preferably clopidogrel) is recommended, with discontinuation of the antiplatelet agent after 6 to 12 months. Furthermore, an aspirin-free strategy after PCI has been investigated in several trials those have started to show the safety and efficacy. The Task Force on Primary PCI of the CVIT group has now proposed the updated expert consensus document for the management of AMI focusing on procedural aspects of primary PCI in 2022 version."

Due to varied presentation and timing, its diagnosis and treatment can be challenging. This article reviews underlying mechanisms and the role of cardiac imaging in investigating and managing this condition. (1). (2).). (3) (4).) (5) (6).) (7).) (8). (9)."
